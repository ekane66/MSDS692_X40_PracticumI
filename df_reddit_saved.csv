Just finally got around to listening to the soundboard Spectrum shows...,"Man it is so great to hear these fall/winter 97 shows in a crispy expertly remastered SBD.  Those of us who were trolling lots in those days for Blanks and postage, and ending up with 47th generations that had so much hiss they were almost more hiss than show, probably appreciate this sentiment too.  Don't get me wrong,  I LOVE me a choice audience that was listened to death.   

I digress.   


This time in phish history...any time you went to a show, you were fucking GUARANTEED a mind blowing, heart rending, blow out of a show.  No matter what they played,
Or how they played it, they were crushing it out the park.  This was. A band and crew who had this gigantic chip on their shoulder, they had something to prove, and at the same time they didn't take it too seriously at all.  It was seriously hilarious and amazing.   Every night.  

1997 spectrum.   What a place and time.  To be part of this gigantic huge secret that the ""main stream"" had no idea about.   People in my hs who didn't know, who made fun or mocked,  I never argued.  I felt bad bc those people had zero fucking idea what a THING they were missing.  What a thing to be apart of and to experience.   So in that vein, these shows just demonstrate that.  Messy perfection.  Dead serious hilarity.   A walking contradiction.  


I don't want to do a note by note break down(and I could believe you me üòÄ)...but for instance.   Gumbo -> 2001 > yem.  Late 90s phish golden perfection.    


Check it OUT!!!

Gratitude Post - Phish members are in their 60‚Äôs and are playing at 11/10. This will end one day‚Ä¶ but not today MF!! ‚ú®üéâüî•,"I just wanted to share a moment of gratitude and would love to hear yours.

I first saw the band in 94 and didn‚Äôt give a crap. It was just a place I could try to score weed near my small town (Providence.) I was 15. 

I saw them at the same venue where I saw Young MC and milli Vanilli 3 years prior‚Ä¶ I was way more stoked on that show than Phish.

Luckily, I had an older sister with a weird music taste sister with a weird music taste and an older girlfriend with a car. My sister played Poor Heart for me (I was a punk and liked NWA) and my mind was kinda blown.

My older girlfriend forced me to get in the car and drive all night weekend thing where phish was playing. I was like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWTVR.. weed.‚Äù

We rolled into the Great Went early in the AM on the second day‚Ä¶ why was everyone awake and so excited‚Ä¶ apparently phish had just played a full set on the back of a flatbed truck. Hmm‚Ä¶ interesting, but I‚Äôm a young 17.. wtvr.

I was new to psychedelics and had the incredible fortune of one of my first acid trips being at the greatest psychedelic rock bands  of my lifetime‚Äôs largest ever concert. There were circus performers on stilts and a silent glider plane doing air acrobatics right above our heads. Eventually, Phish played something where they went into what I called ‚Äúthe vortex‚Äù: nearly complete abstraction, that was somehow still dance music. (Something they‚Äôve been doing much more lately).

I heard the band for the first time in that moment. Third concert, three+ hours from home, in a crowd of (and I counted) 1 trillion people who were under the spell of these weird musical shamans‚Ä¶.

I could tell my whole phish story, how I went to all the festivals, went to 1999-2000 NYE alone, I saw Oysterhead‚Äôs final show, I met Trey once and pretended I didn‚Äôt know who he was so I wouldn‚Äôt look like a dork (good luck,) how I decided to skip MSGamehenge because the Sat night show was so good, I didn‚Äôt want to spoil it. 

But that‚Äôs all a long story. 

A big part of my life today is sitting in ceremony with some of the world‚Äôs greatest Ayahuasca guides in musicians. Truly, seeing up close how these musicians sculpted and shape peoples entire psyche and move them through deep personal transformation. I feel like I finally understood the thing Phish is great at is what would be called in any other time or culture shamanism. To viscerally feel them sculpt the energy of 20,000 people and help them collectively and individually express and explore their deepest and most pure selves, I realize how lucky I am to live in the dimension where we have Phish!

I‚Äôm going to die. I love you but you‚Äôre going to die too. These magical people have dedicate their lives to helping us be more free. I post this with deep gratitude for you and your journey in the fact that by some strange set of circumstances, our journeys are intertwined through the greatest psychedelic rock band that‚Äôs ever existed.

And PS - I got a last minute ticket to see Gamehenge and had a 10 seat wide dancing row to myself. I cried a lot of joy that night!!

Mexico - can you stay off-site?,"I want to go but it‚Äôs a hard sell to bail on family for 4-5 days to go to a tropical location without them.

Do normal tropical vacation, just bail for a few hours every night to see the shows.  Actually they would probably want to go once, wife maybe twice.  Am I kidding myself?  I don‚Äôt see it working at the resort.  Kids don‚Äôt like phish, and wife is so-so.  Any input from those who have been before would be much appreciated.  ",Mexico stay

A Special Photo,"This print just got back from the framers. It came out stunning. 

If the photographer is in this sub, Scott Harris Photo, I hope you approve of our framing and matting choices. 

The back story:  I never knew of any Phish songs until I met my hubbins. Growing up, my sister and I were more into R&B, Rap, HipHop, and (it was the 90s) some Alternative. 

My first Phish concert was in 2010. I‚Äôm not going to say I fell in love with them, but I enjoyed the experience. Since then, I‚Äôve been to about a dozen or so concerts, and I really do like their songs. 

One song in particular, kind of got me. ‚ÄúDrift While You‚Äôre Sleeping.‚Äù The words are beautiful and would give me the chills. I thought it was a song my sister would like, even though her only exposure to Phish was when she drove with my husband and me. But the lyrics, ‚ÄúWe move through stormy weather, we know that are days are few. And we dream and we struggle together. And love will carry us through.‚Äù 

I wanted to tell my sister about this song and the lyrics, but it never came up. We‚Äôd talk about other things. (Usually some gossip that she‚Äôd preface with, ‚ÄúYou wanna hear some sh**?‚Äù) Then I would be home, ‚ÄúDrift‚Äù would come on, and I‚Äôd shrug and tell myself ‚Äúnext time.‚Äù

You probably know where this is going. In October of 2022 (almost six months after she turned 40), I ran out of ‚Äúnext times.‚Äù She died in her sleep, just hours after we went to a hockey game together. 

Fast forward to last year‚Äôs MSG run for NYE. I was able to get four day passes for my hubbins and me. Night 2, Phish ended their first set with ‚ÄúDrift While You‚Äôre Sleeping.‚Äù I smiled a little sadly, and swayed to the music. But, then those lyrics. In particular, ‚ÄúWe know that are days are few.‚Äù I broke down in the nosebleeds of Madison Square Garden. Missing my little sister.

I don‚Äôt know how many days later, but I was scrolling through Instagram, and saw the gorgeous photos taken by Scott Harris during that NYE run. As soon as I saw this time one, the one taken during ‚ÄúDrift,‚Äù during my little break down, I knew I had to have it. 

If you read this whole thing, thank you. And if you didn‚Äôt, I take no offense. I just wanted to share my story. ",Special Photo

6/22/94 Appreciation Thread,"I've been listening to this show for the last few weeks on my morning runs. It's always been a favorite, but I think learning more about the context of the show has really made me appreciate it even more. I hadn't listened to the OJ show before this Monday, and it struck me that 6/22, like 6/17, features the band reacting in real time to a breaking event and relating news to the audience- Trey is providing updates on game 7 of Rockets-Knicks. That news seems to influence the music as well- the Icculus sounds like Trey trying to will the Knicks to the game 7 victory, calling out Hakeem by name. You get two Mikes->Simple->Hydrogen->Grooves within 5 days. (I learned today that it was the second and third time that this combination was done). And they are both riddled with little gems- 6/17 has a Kung and a Harpua, 6/22 has Catapult, Icculus, and Avenu Malkenu.

Anyway, two special shows to celebrate this week. Any other thoughts on or love for 6/22/94?",Appreciation Thread

[1] Phish debut.  
[2] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Winterqueen](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/winterqueen>) \- > from ""It's Ice."" Mike has strong play from the start and Trey's play is airy and bouncy, as usual. Page mirrors Trey in a complementary fashion and Fish's delicate, driving drums keep the jam going. Strong play from the entire band in this version.   
  
[Crosseyed and Painless](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/crosseyed-and-painless>) \- Pivots to a light and airy major key jam, upon which Trey steps into the spotlight and delivers some powerful and emotive soloing. Comes to a powerful close and > into an equally good ""Everything's Right"".   
  
[Ruby Waves](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ruby-waves>) \- First improvisational version wastes no time delving into a dark swampy zone with Page's synths leading the way, Mike going to the envelope filter to add some extra filthiness. Fish picks up the pace and Trey moves to a nice low-key groove with some ""Weekapaug""-y tones, with some ""Crosseyed"" quotes for funsies. The band gooses some woos, then finds a nice -> into ""Twist"".   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the Phish debut of Halfway Home. Trey teased My Soul in
Gumbo. Crosseyed and Painless was quoted and teased in Everything's Right and
quoted in Ruby Waves, Twist, and Wilson. Ruby Waves was unfinished. Wilson
included a quote of The Birds.

[1] Mule duel featured Page on theremin.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Scent of a Mule](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/scent-of-a-mule>) \- Most improvisational version in 12+ years that includes an extended Mule Duel with Page on theremin at one point.   
  
[Simple](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/simple>) \- The typical jam breaks into a short dreamy, lightly pulsing abstraction, before settling into extended transition space and > to ""Light.""   
  
[Weekapaug Groove](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/weekapaug-groove>) \- Nice plinko-style funk breakdown, a second little Mike/Page breakdown, then more improvisational play before an unsual conclusion which -> to ""Seven Below.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Maze featured an Eleanor Rigby tease from Page and Trey. The Mule duel featured
Page on theremin. YEM contained a Scent of a Mule tease from Trey. Weekapaug

Encore  : [ Waste ](<https://phish.net/song/waste>)

[1] No intro.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- The customary ""Gin"" jam breaks into a low-key groove which eventually returns to ""Gin"" to end.   
  
[Nothing](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/nothing>) \- You wouldn't expect a song like ""Nothing"" to yield such a brooding jam, although considering the date, it may not be a complete surprise. Either way, this improvisational version is a unique experience, and concludes with a long tug-of-war segue -> ""46 Days"".   
  
[Scents and Subtle Sounds](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/scents-and-subtle-sounds>) \- No intro. At first sedate and soothing, the jam grows increasingly dissonant and tension filled, with an almost growly anger to it. Very improvisational version that includes an ""NO2"" tease.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Ya Mar contained a Stash tease. Scents did not have the intro. Trey teased The
Rover at the end of Cavern.

[1] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Ya Mar](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ya-mar>) \- Sticks pretty close to the typical format, but the band really stretches this one out patiently, without a hint at all of feeling eager to get to the next song.   
  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- This is your '00-style ""Type I"" HOSE jam. A great upbeat version, the tone and sound of this ""Gin"" is markedly different from other standout ""Type I"" versions like 8/17/97, 11/20/98, and 9/12/99. Released on Live Bait Vol. 8.   
  
[Farmhouse](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/farmhouse>) \- A classic '00 version in every sense, this ""Farmhouse"" serves as a foil for the 9/28/99 version, and features a much more mellow, restrained yet interesting jam including some cool repetitive riffs from Trey near the conclusion.   
  
[Makisupa Policeman](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/makisupa-policeman>) \- Trey plays a spry, gentle solo that starts off lilting and pretty and then speeds up without ever losing its light feel. The version also has a nice vocal reprise and a decent outro.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Disease was unfinished.

[1] No whistling.  
[2] Unfinished; with verse of Abba's Waterloo.  
[3] John Popper on harmonica.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- ""Plinko"" play from Trey, periodically offset by strumming, jumpstarts the jam, and works to create incredible syncopation. Predictably great guitar is matched by Mike, with the two musicians not so much dueling, as driving the version through any number of impressive ideas and rhythmic shifts. Great and unpredictable improvisation follows, with all four members contributing in equal measure, as if exacting a singular vision.   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- THRILLING jam!   
  
[Runaway Jim](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/runaway-jim>) \- Red hot, strong, compact, and unusual second set opener, Fish, direct from the vocals, drives strong and Impassioned play, the four Creating a controlled cacophony (typical fare for the year), with Mike holding some great notes and igniting great patterned play, page Pounding his keys before Trey alights on a riff which rises to break free to inform incendiary soloing. Play gets really cool as the band drives to a false peak and the jam becomes demented, an extended passage of ""not at all what's expected,'"" before the traditional spirited release -> into ""The Lizards.""   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- 1995's most exploratory, improvisational version. One of the ""Antelope"" clan which weaves back and forth between familiar ground and improvisation. The jam here gets out into some spacey and eerie Summer '95-style territory.   
  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- John Popper on harmonica. -> in from ""Harpua,"" during which Jimmy decides he hates the band Abba, and needs to listen to some rocking harmonica music, which is precisely what this jam is. -> to ""Llama.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Reba did not have the whistling ending. Harpua was unfinished; Jimmy played an
Abba record (which led to a verse of Abba's Waterloo), decided that he hated
Abba and thought that maybe a little rocking harmonica would tighten it up. John
Popper then came out for to play harmonica on a jam that led into Llama. Llama
and GTBT also featured John Popper on harmonica. It's Magic was part of the
soundcheck's My Sweet One Refrain Medley.

scary phan / cyber-stalking,"Hey all. Looking for some helping friendly advice on a pretty disturbing and potentially dangerous situation. 

Myself and another girlfriend in the phish community have been receiving some pretty terrifying messages from an individual on Instagram who seems to be a tour regular. He is essentially obsessed with my friend and has sent me threatening messages claiming I‚Äôm getting in the way of him dating her. Neither of us know this guy nor have ever met him, and we have not engaged with him online. From what I can tell he is a lone wolf with some pretty intense mental health issues. 

I know there is a lot going around on Instagram within the community right now about outing dudes for being abusive/inappropriate to female fans but this is just plain scary. Although we always use good judgement and stick together, Phish shows have always felt like a totally safe space for me and my friends, so this is a major bummer ahead of summer tour. 

Aside from blocking / reporting him on social, I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has advice on how we can protect ourselves or potentially alert authorities, venues, etc. i have never found myself in this sort of situation before.

[1] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Tube](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tube>) \- A smooth modulation to major around 4:30 paves the way for the band to ride a wave of feel-good vibes to a clean peak with Trey's ringing leads out front.   
  
[Steam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/steam>) \- Features an unusual shift to upbeat major play at 5:45 and ventures further afield with some ""Wider""-esque reggae grooving before returning home.   
  
[No Men In No Man's Land](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/no-men-in-no-mans-land>) \- Playful and plucky first-set play hearkens back to the ""day,"" with Trey seamlessly blending ""Blister In The Sun"" into a fiery version which probably doesn't, but may, hint at ""China Cat Sunflower"" before the song's closing vocal refrain. > ""The Horse.""   
  
[Backwards Down the Number Line](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/backwards-down-the-number-line>) \- While the jam section begins typically, Trey's confidence seems to grow as he proceeds, with fancy finger work and cohesive play leading to a rousing conclusion.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Friend was a Phish debut. No Men in No Man's Land had a Blister in the Sun tease
by Trey.

Encore  : [ Fluffhead ](<https://phish.net/song/fluffhead>)

[1] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Kill Devil Falls](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/kill-devil-falls>) \- Includes an eerie outro full of creepy effects that sounds like it was taken right out of the IT festival and transitions (>) to an equally menacing ""Twist.""   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- At 6:15, the jam breaks from ""Twist,"" taking on a haunting, spectral tone that grows increasingly powerful. The jam settles briefly, then gains energy and gets more upbeat, launching into a ""Heaven On Their Minds"" jam (from Jesus Christ Superstar), before winding down and > to ""Halley's Comet.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Shaggy Dog was played for the first time since October 29, 1995 (576 shows).
Runaway Jim and Fluffhead contained When the Saints Go Marching In teases from
Trey. Following Stash, Poor Heart and Moma Dance were quickly aborted due to
Fish mistakes. Trey suggested that they play a song that started with drums and
Llama was subsequently played. Trey later said that Buffalo Bill was one of his
all time personal favorites that starts with the drums. After Buffalo Bill, Trey
said Fish was a master of songs that he starts himself.  In the Bowie intro,
Trey told the crowd that this was Chris Kuroda's favorite Phish song (having
Kuroda give a thumbs up to confirm), adding that ""every day back stage, before
we walk on, we say 'Chris? What should we play tonight?' and he only says one
song. Every night."" DWD was unfinished. Twist contained an Eleanor Rigby tease
from Trey and a Heaven on Their Minds (from J _esus Christ Superstar_ ) jam.
This show featured the first Fluffhead encore since November 3, 1990 (1,124
shows).

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Limb By Limb](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/limb-by-limb>) \- Why many folks consider the ""LxL"" jam somewhat similar to The Grateful Dead's ""Crazy Fingers."" Trey soars in this version.   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Scorching hot.   
  
[Gotta Jibboo](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/gotta-jibboo>) \- Swift and high-energy playing throughout. A clean, linear build in energy, from patient and quiet interplay between Page and Trey at the beginning, building with whale call bends and rotary swirl, finally ascending to a heavenly peak. Very happy and massive hose during the peak; spacey jam on the back end -> to ""2001.""   
  
[Sand](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sand>) \- An interesting jam which takes a more reserved, melodic route with Fish playing unaccompanied for a time as the band comes down to near silence briefly. The latter part of the jam includes some effects from Page and a nice ascending progression.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- Robbie McCoury on banjo, Ronnie McCoury on mandolin, and Sam Bush on fiddle. ""Hood"" intro -> ""Dog Faced Boy"" > ""Hood."" Unfortunately the AUD recording does not do justice to this cool instrumental arrangement. KS - Live Bait Vol. ?   
  
[Dog Faced Boy](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/dog-faced-boy>) \- -> in from the intro to ""Hood."" Robbie McCoury on banjo, Ronnie McCoury on mandolin and Sam Bush on fiddle. ""Dog Faced Boy"" is played in entirety in the intro. > back to ""Hood.""   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- > in from ""Dog Faced Boy."" This great ""Hood"" now launches, but the AUD recording does not do justice to the great and different instrumentation.   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- EXCELLENT jam segment.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Wolfman's included an In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida tease. Hood featured Robbie McCoury on
banjo, Ronnie McCoury on mandolin and Sam Bush on fiddle. I'm Blue I'm Lonesome,
the Phish debut of Hold Whatcha Got, Uncle Pen, and Free Bird also included Del
McCoury on guitar, Ricky Skaggs on mandolin, Mike Bub on upright double-bass,
and Jason Carter on fiddle in addition to those already on stage. Free Bird
featured Wynonna Judd on lead vocals and was played with full instrumentation,
as opposed to the usual _a cappella_ arrangement.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Theme From the Bottom](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/theme-from-the-bottom>) \- Intense, well played version approaches the conclusion, and then morphs into an eerie, psychedelic 5 minute exploration that gains some propulsion before a -> into the ""Fleezer,"" a monster version of ""Tweezer.""   
  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- -> in from ""Theme From The Bottom."" An eerie, psychedelic jam follows ""Theme,"" gains some propulsion, and -> to the ""Fleezer,"" a monster 45 minute ""Tweezer"" -> ""Tweezer Reprise"" combination.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- The Finger Lakes ""FLeezer."" Another masterpiece of Phish improv that segues into ""Tweeprise."" Must-f'ing-hear. Includes Fish on vacuum for a spell, and a ""My Generation"" jam.   
  
[Tweezer Reprise](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer-reprise>) \- -> in from ""Tweezer"" to close out the famed ""Fleezer.""   

  
**Show Notes:**

Fleezer,"" contained a My Generation jam, Rift teases from Mike, and, at one
point, a Fish vacuum accompaniment. In the soundcheck, Funky Bitch was performed
as the blues version and Dog Log ended with the AC/DC Bag intro.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- Although this version mostly stays inbounds, the boys play the tension card to full-effect, and the ending is unusual.   
  
[Simple](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/simple>) \- Crazy medley, where ""Simple"" is played to the melody of the Allman Brothers' ""Midnight Rider"" at one point, and segues back and forth to ""Catapult"" and ""Icculus"" in a must-hear ""Mike's Groove.""   
  
[Midnight Rider](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/midnight-rider>) \- -> in from ""Simple."" Lyrics to ""Simple"" are sung to the melody of the Allman Brothers Band's ""Midnight Rider."" -> to ""Catapult.""

[Simple](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/simple>) \- -> in from ""Catapult,"" as this ""Simple"" medley of songs continues. -> to ""Icculus.""   
  
[Icculus](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/icculus>) \- -> in from ""Simple."" A high energy, highly amusing version of ""Icculus,"" ripe with NBA references, appears midway through an incredible ""Simple"" medley.   
  
[Simple](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/simple>) \- This concluding section of ""Simple"" follows a classic performance of ""Icculus"" and -> to ""Mike's Song.""   
  
[Jesus Just Left Chicago](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jesus-just-left-chicago>) \- Trey brings the volume way down, then he and the band bring the intensity up to a near boil. Fish is great.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey teased Fire (Ohio Players) in Maze. My Sweet One was performed acoustic
and, along with Carolina, without microphones. Catapult was sung over the

Most big live music events these days don't allow ""cameras with detachable lenses"" and I really don't understand this. I DO understand a restriction on lens zoom a little bit...they might not want you taking excellent photos of the band (though this is pretty silly as well) but just because it has a detachable lens doesn't mean you have a long focal length. Also, just because a lens is ""longer"" doesn't mean it's a zoomy lens. My 16-35mm f2.8 is fairly long looking but its max focal length is 35mm! I really just want a lens like that for photographing friends and phans. The truth is that everyone with a cellphone can zoom more than I can with that thing. The difference is I want to shoot with better dynamic range and control. I get so much out of the experience of having a camera on me and it's super disappointing to be denied on in the festival grounds.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Runaway Jim](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/runaway-jim>) \- A number of recent versions (see: 7/25/18 and 10/20/18) demonstrate the band's renewed interest in one of their finest compositions. Given your preference (the spirited first ""half"" of early-90's ""Runaway Foams,"" or the crazed, free-form improvisation found within something like Shoreline 1997's II-opening jam), the band delivers an exciting amount of content, befitting triumphant ""Funiculi Funicula"" teasing. The entire ride is worthy of attention, but, true to 2019's style, Phish squeezes out an incredible amount of interesting improvisation, so remain tuned in to the outro, which doesn't so much fade as hint at a ""DDLJ"" before > ""SaSS.""   
  
[A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/a-song-i-heard-the-ocean-sing>) \- Wastes no time moving to a warm major key jam (with charming ""If I Only Had A Brain"" teases) that picks up speed and gets almost tropical at Page's urging, before shifting to some tasty rocking out and letting Mike really shine. A lot of meat packed into a smaller frame.   
  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- > from ""20 Years Later."" After a normal start to the song, at 5:50 the band shifts to a quiet, minimalist jam for about a minute. At this point, Trey starts singing the words to ""Have Mercy"" over the jam and the rest of the band follows suit. ""Have Mercy"" is sung over the jam for a moment, and then more typical ""Possum"" play until the song is brought to a rousing conclusion.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The first Tweezer included Walk This Way teases from Trey. Trey teased Mercury
in the second Tweezer. Runaway Jim contained Funiculi Funicula teases from Trey.
Scents and Subtle Sounds did not have the intro. Trey teased If I Only Had a
Brain and Mike teased Gotta Jibboo in A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing. Taste
included a Scents and Subtle Sounds tease from Trey. Have Mercy was quoted in
Possum. The Final Hurrah was quoted at the end of Tweezer Reprise.

[1] Unfinished.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Crosseyed and Painless](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/crosseyed-and-painless>) \- Very nice second set opener. This one rips from start to finish. Around the 9:30 min mark, Trey and Page really catch a hold of something and blaze through the back of the jam. At 12:30, it starts to explore spacier realms that eventually lead into ""Down with Disease.""   
  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- Page gets the jam section off to a great start, then Trey zeroes in on a nice blues riff. Taking turns playing off this riff, Trey and Page team up nicely, before the jam eventually dissolves into familiar '09 transition space.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
During Brother, each of the band members' children jumped into a bathtub placed
at the side of the stage. Afterwards, Trey introduced them and wished everyone a
happy Fathers' Day. Funky Bitch was played in acknowledgement of a fan who had
been holding up a sign requesting the song at this show and the previous one.
Crosseyed and Painless included a brief, subtle tease from Page of the Grateful
Dead's Let It Grow. Trey teased Taste near the end of Disease, which was
unfinished. Piper contained a brief Can't You Hear Me Knocking tease.
Frankenstein featured Page on the keytar and Trey on a five-neck guitar.

**Show Notes:**  
  
Phish performed on top of the theater's second-floor marquee at West 53rd Street
and Broadway. The soundcheck earlier that day included an instrumental jam
similar to Quantegy. The first Scents was taped for _The Late Show with David
Letterman_ and aired that night. Then Phish waited as Paul Shaffer and his band
(from inside the theater) played an instrumental version of The Night They Drove
Old Dixie Down. The remainder of Phish's performance was for the benefit of a
few hundred fans assembled on the sidewalk across the street. Neither version of
Scents contained the intro. This version of 2001 contained only one ""verse.""

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- The jam breaks to funk early, returns to ""Twist,"" then a very good funky-blues jam develops which gets energized and upbeat. A quieter, spacey section follows before a return to the funk-blues jam and > to ""Cavern.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Samson Variation debuted at this show. This single-set performance was part of
the inaugural Hurricane Festival that also featured Ani DiFranco, Bad Religion,

[1] Atypical jam.  
[2] Acoustic; without microphones.  
[3] Without microphones.  
[4] Without amplification.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[My Friend, My Friend](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/my-friend-my-friend>) \- The jam includes a nice little tease/jam on Rick Derringer's ""Rock And Roll, Hoochie Koo"" (which sounds similar to Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick"").   
  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- The jam starts into a tense, exploratory groove before launching into a stunning, melodic Mike/Trey duet. At 12:00, the tension and power return, but the jam doesn't return to ""SOAM"" proper until 14:00.   
  
[Esther](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/esther>) \- Mike mows everyone down on this bass-centric version. 1994 is a great year for ""Esther,"" and here is one reason why. Page's and Trey's solos smoke, but it's Mike's powerful playing that distinguishes this version, not a song one normally associates with Mike.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- The jam has spots of improvisational playing, including an unusual and dark section from 6:55 - 8:00, and a nicely trilling peak.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
After a few lines of The Horse, the fire alarm went off. The band kept playing
but the house lights came on and the building was cleared for 20 minutes. The
music resumed with Fire, and that was the only ""set break."" My Friend included a
Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo jam. SOAM subsequently included additional Rock and
Roll, Hoochie Koo teases and an atypical jam. Chalk Dust contained Barracuda
teases. Suzy contained a Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo tease from Trey. Ginseng
Sullivan through Dog Faced Boy were performed acoustic and without microphones,
and Sweet Adeline and Amazing Grace were performed without microphones.

[1] Aborted and had to be restarted.  
[2] False start, ""Daubs"" and ""Seth"" lyrics, Fish on trombone.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Jesus Just Left Chicago](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jesus-just-left-chicago>) \- Fantastic Trey as he builds the jam from low-down, mournful blues to church service-like inspirational rocking.   
  
[Whipping Post](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/whipping-post>) \- The extended first jam is unusually improvisational, seems to come back to normal ""Whipping Post,"" then breaks into dissonant ""DEG""-like jamming, and then more exploration. The second jam features Page on the B-3 and is more soothing and straightforward than the first.

Mockingbird was aborted and had to be restarted due to error.  Fire contained
DEG teases from Trey. GTBT was dedicated to Don Drive and East Coast Printers. I
Didn't Know had a false start, lyrics changed to reference ""Daubs"" and ""Seth,""
and featured Fish on trombone.

Scott's son, Ian Murawski, and Mike's daughter, Tessa Gordon, on vocals. A fire
alarm set off during intermission forced a temporary evacuation of everyone from
the building.

I am a huge dead fan, and I really like having the recordings in my iTunes. Idk man, I just like having it my self. The subscription is cool, but can you buy individual shows that aren't released on spotify/iTunes etc?

For instance, today I have loved 6/24/12 in Cuyahoga Falls. Id love to have it if I decide to not use live phish.

My First Show Was 20 Years Ago Today,"The photo is from this morning. Inexplicably, I‚Äôve kept this ticket stub for all this time, but perhaps even more so, I remember that weekend so clearly. 

My friend, P.A., invited me, and we went in a group with four of our friends and her little brother. Tent poles went missing at our camp site. Car keys were locked inside vehicles at Lake George. A teenage hitchhiker from South Carolina asked us to point them back to Coney Island. Memories of music and mischief from that weekend were mnemonically infused in my mind forever. 

That summer I also went with P.A. to one of the Mansfield shows, and yes, then we went to Coventry. She hasn‚Äôt seen Phish since 2004 and lives in California, so I‚Äôm trying to persuade her to meet me at Dick‚Äôs this year‚Ä¶",First Show Years Ago Today

I want to hear Contact jammed out.,"One of my all time favorite Phish tunes.  Quirky and fun.  Like nothing I‚Äôd ever heard the first time I popped my bootleg cassette version of Junta into my boom box in the seventh grade.

I‚Äôve always thought the near-end of this song was asking to be jammed out.  Have they done it?",want hear Contact jammed
20 years ago today my life changed forever,"I have a short little story to tell, if you‚Äôll hang with me for a few minutes.

In 2004, I was an 18-year old senior in HS and my stoner friends invited me up to SPAC to see the band Phish.  They‚Äôd been talking about it for a while, and kept trying to get me to like the band during our blaze sessions.  It wasn‚Äôt working haha.  In the interim, I declined actual ticket offers (including free pavs) due to being firmly a death metal kid.  However, I was also knee-deep in drugs at the time.  A couple years prior, I had my throat sliced open during hockey practice and was self-medicating the PTSD with opiates.  

I knew that Phish meant drugs, so I went and hung out and scored.  I stuck around for the music though, and hung outside the fence.  I listened, and was mesmerized and perplexed by what was happening.  

The music was strange, but powerful.  However, the thing that got me was whatever the fuck was happening over the lawn audience.  What the hell was that?  Arcs of light‚Ä¶ did they put lasers in the crowd?  And what was that SONG?  It started real soft and quiet, and then built, and built, and built‚Ä¶.  Something about a worm.  And those lights!  It lasted forever!  What the hell WAS that over the lawn audience?!

I didn‚Äôt know what the hell I was witnessing, but it struck me hard and the memory lasted forever.  My journey towards understanding this band had begun.  I soon acquired Quinn‚Äôs copy of the 2nd set cd, and got Junta at a local store.  My transition from death metal to hippie was complete.  


Fast forward to today, I am now clean (entered rehab exactly one year later!) and have a new crew of Phish friends I also play music with.  One friend, Eddie, was also at his first show that night and had the same lasting impression from the glow war during Piper.  He made these shirts years ago, which are cool.

Now we play music together in Glass Pony, which is also cool.  But without the glow war during that Piper, I may not be here today.  That jam and experience changed my life, helped me get clean, inspired me to play jam music, and keeps me focused today.  When I need help, I go to this jam.  

Thank you Phish.  You changed my life at both of our darkest times.  Now we get to enjoy the fruits of our work, both of us.  


As Jerry said, once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right.  Pretty crazy.


Anyone else remember that fucking glow war?!",years ago today life changed forever

Low-ball Ticket Offers ,"Understand this, as stupid as it is, if you come in stupid low, I'd rather eat the ticket than pay for your good time when the alternative right now is for you is to march yourself over to the box office and pay full face +fees to AEG like I did. 

Be reasonable though and I'll accept your offer. I get it, it's not that serious. And I've definitely miracled people before and I understand how markets work, but you have to know low-balling other fans is jerk behavior. And me not giving into a low-ball offer helps the next person not have to accept one either.
Pony-up, folks.  Don't have all the cash? Offer me something in trade to supplement. A vintage tee, a hug, something. Anything. You're looking for a deal, you can't come to the table with only your hand out. 

Thanks for listening. ",Ticket Offers

**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey introduced Dog Log with ""There's enough of those damn signs out there."" Dog
Log was last played on August 2, 2003 (172 shows). Hood was unfinished. Prior to
Sleeping Monkey, Trey teased the  _Star Wars_  theme and said ""Fish, when you
get to the end of this beautiful song, one last time for all of us. One final
tuck."" Trey added that ""it's been a beautiful two days, but it wouldn't be
complete without seeing Fish tuck his dress into his underwear one last time""
and ""I'm singing this one right to you Fish, because I am your father."" Trey
proceeded to sing to Fish using Mike's mic. Tweezer Reprise contained Sleeping
Monkey quotes from Fish.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Drowned](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/drowned>) \- Nice jam that bounces along before slowing to a more spacious sentiment that sets up nicely for a transition into ""Swept Away/Steep.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
In what is becoming a Father's Day tradition (see 6/21/09), the show-opening
Brother featured the band members' children jumping into a bathtub on stage,
followed by Trey introducing each of them and wishing everyone a Happy Father's
Day. Gotta Jibboo was preceded by a ""Charge!"" tease from Page and featured Tony
Markellis on bass and Mike on a second guitar. In Antelope, ""Marco Esquandolas""
was changed to ""Mike-O Esquandolas,"" followed by a Mike solo. The end of Wilson
contained a Dixie tease from Trey. In place of a traditional Makisupa keyword,
Trey improvised verses that set up solos for Mike, then Fish, then Page. The
subsequent Piper intro included repeated phrases from the Makisupa (""Policeman,""
""House,"" and ""Listen to Mike""). Trey quoted Whole Lotta Love in the vocal jam of
YEM. Page performed Frankenstein on keytar.

Encore  : [ Good Times Bad Times ](<https://phish.net/song/good-times-bad-times>)

[1] Dr. Jack McConnell on vocals and tap shoes.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Waves](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/waves>) \- Although the jam between verses is standard ""Waves"" fare, the band moves into an excellent 7 minute plus jam following the final verse that is rhythmic and upbeat, with multiple movements and ""Maze"" teases.   
  
[Drowned](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/drowned>) \- A high quality, multi-faceted jam with building intensity. The later jam segment sounds somewhat like the jam portion of ""Kill Devil Falls,"" which wouldn't emerge for another 4 years.   
  
[Seven Below](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/seven-below>) \- The original Seven Below>Ghost combo. This one starts out very dark and brooding, and it slowly rolls into an up-tempo romp!   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- -> in from ""Ghost."" Excellent multi-section jam starts at 5:45, breaking into a funky, pulsing section. The jam picks up a nice swinging vibe, intensifies and grows ""HOSE""-like, then ends with a brief power rocking > fade.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
During Julius, Trey broke a string on stage for the first known time since
November 29, 1996. This Father's Day version of Bill Bailey - the first since
July 3, 1999 (167 shows) - featured Page's dad, Dr. Jack McConnell, on vocals
and tap shoes. Trey teased Lazy (Deep Purple) in Drowned.

[1] Phish debut.  
[2] lyrics were changed to ""Been you to have any spike tongue"" and Marco
Esquandolas was changed to ""The Jersey drunk.""  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- > in from ""Taste."" A weird, funky jazz-like jam which -> to ""Cities.""   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- A straightforward, but funkified jam breaks around 8:00 into a low key, funky jam that at times sounds similar to Santana's ""Oye Como Va"" before returning to ""Twist."" The ""Oye Como Va"" connection would solidify with time.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Ain't Love Funny made its Phish debut at this show and was played out of an odd,
atypical jam that grew out of Horn. Antelope's lyrics were changed to ""Been you
to have any spike tongue"" and Marco Esquandolas was changed to ""The Jersey
drunk."" Ghost included San-Ho-Zay teases from Trey. Julius contained a brief
Stairway to Heaven tease from Trey.

Encore  : [ Slave to the Traffic Light ](<https://phish.net/song/slave-to-the-traffic-light>) , [ Amazing Grace ](<https://phish.net/song/amazing-grace>)


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Foam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/foam>) \- Great mini build-up at the end of Page's solo. Mike is strong during the quiet section of Trey's solo. Powerful build-up.   
  
[If I Could](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/if-i-could>) \- Trey skillfully deploys the Leslie to great effect following some beautiful Page piano action.   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Typical '95 Phish where they manage to pack a ton of music and jamming into a relatively short space of time. This jam explores multiple directions. High quality fare.   
  
[Mike's Song](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mikes-song>) \- A quick, uneventful 1st jam drops swiftly into deep, dark Summer '95 exploration. At first, this 2nd jam is mostly a threatening, evil soundscape. But a steady beat from Mike and Fish, and directed playing by Trey bring it back to a rocking form. Following some pulsing play from 12:00 to 15:30, things slip back into the murky abyss, where they remain until a welcome brightening and -> to ""Contact.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The soundcheck's My Generation was performed acoustic. Bathtub Gin contained
Long Tall Glasses teases from Trey. This show is available as an archival
release on LivePhish.com.

[2] Jah Roy on vocals.  
[3] Fish on trombone.  
[4] First known Phish performance.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Ya Mar](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ya-mar>) \- Segues into Reggae Fest Vol. 2. with Jah Roy   
  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- With Jah Roy on vocals. Reggae Fest Vol. 2.   
  
[Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sneakin-sally-through-the-alley>) \- High power bridge with some great Trey. Long vocal jam with more animal-like screams, howls and other weird sounds.   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Definitely stretches the boundaries of ""Type I"" jamming, especially after 9:00, then at 12:00 it really gets out there into some interesting exploration.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the first known Phish performance of Satin Doll.  Fluffhead's
lyrics were changed to ""sure got some Bette Davis eyes"" and the song later
contained a ""Get up John-Boy"" quote (in reference to _The Waltons_ ). The jam
out of Ya Mar featured Jah Roy on vocals. During the jam, Jah Roy quoted lines
from many famous reggae tunes, including One Love, Three Little Birds, and Stir
It Up. I Didn't Know featured Fish on trombone. A-Train featured a _Flintstones_
theme tease from Trey. This setlist is likely incomplete.

I absolutely love the dark sludgey vibe to it. Feel like with how they've been playing recently they could do something special with it and take it deep.",Play Play

[1] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Birds of a Feather](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/birds-of-a-feather>) \- Fan favorite from 2019. Immediately moves into a warm and soothing zone with Page's electric piano leading the way, then briefly picks up steam and lets Trey cook before sliding into a grimy synth-laden groove that Fish drives with some thunderous drumming. A nice semi-tropical jam emerges and gives way to a woo/sample-off, and then the band rebuilds the jam and pushes for a super peak. The nifty little post-peak groove they tack onto the end is just icing on the cake.   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Amusing ""BOAF""-inflected song portion (with an equally amusing botch). Briefly pops its head into the clouds for some major-key bliss at Trey's urging, Page flips his electric piano to the ""calypso"" setting to add some nice color to the jam. Trey hits on some neat repeating riffs as the jam builds up a nice low-key power, then gently steers the band into ""Slave"".   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the Phish debut of A Life Beyond The Dream. Trey teased No
Men In No Man's Land in Back on the Train. Page teased HYHU after I Didn't Know.
Birds of a Feather contained a Dave's Energy Guide tease from Trey and The Final
Hurrah and Your Pet Cat quotes. Split Open and Melt was performed as an encore
for the first time since November 12, 1991 (1,318 shows).

**Show Notes:**  
  
Carl Gerhard sat in on trumpet for Party Time. Trey introduced Gerhard as having
come to the School of Phish in 1991 and talked about Gerhard's teaching career
in the Armed Services. Trey acknowledged the crowd's request by playing Tube.
During I Didn't Know, Trey said that they took Fish on the road in 1983 and he
went to the Phish School of Music, adding that he was now the executive officer
of the ""Air Force."" Trey said he didn't think Fish should be representing the
vacuum cleaners without tucking in his shirt (a.k.a. his dress) and asked him to
do so (Fish complied). Antelope included alternate lyrics ""Been you to tuck in
your dress, man?"" ""Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck"" and ""Tuck in your dress man, you're
out of control!"" Trey also said that for 30 years, Fish has been leaving his
dress untucked and told everybody to tuck in their dresses. Mike, Trey, and Page
tucked in their shirts before the setbreak bow. Split Open and Melt included the
alternate lyrics ""Split open and tuck."" Backwards Down the Number Line contained
a DEG tease from Trey. Lengthwise included an invitation for audience members to
appear on stage and tuck (a few fans came on stage), contained alternate lyrics
""When you're there, I sleep tuckwise, and when you're tucked, I sleep, you
really have to tuck"" and ""I sleep diagonal in my tuck,"" and Trey wielding a
light saber, saying ""the force is weak with that one. And that one too. But the
force is strong with that one.""  The audience was subsequently called out by
Fish, Trey, and Page, in part being told repeatedly ""You suck at tucking"" over
the Maze intro. The Maze intro also featured Trey asking Chris Kuroda to turn
off the lights while he waved the light saber around, talked like Darth Vader,
saying ""I am your father, Fish. I am your father,"" and played the guitar with
his light saber. Fire contained more Tuck references, with Trey saying ""Tuck
it!"" and the alternate lyrics ""Let the Tucker take over!"" Mike and Trey sported
sombreros for Mexican Cousin.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Sand](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sand>) \- The band put on an impressive display of focused group improvisation in this great funky jam, which also featured stop-start jamming and a short reprise of the jam before ending the song. > into ""Sneakin' Sally.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Harpua included a Happy Birthday tease from Trey and featured all of the band's
fathers voicing the part of Jimmy's father. For the third Father's Day in a row,
Brother was performed and featured all of the band's children on stage and
subsequent introductions. The theme to _Leave it to Beaver_ was teased by Mike
prior to DWD. This show marked the Phish debut of Thunder Road, which was
dedicated by Trey to Clarence Clemons (who had passed away a day earlier). Near
the end of Sand, there was a lengthy pause before the band finished the song.

[1] Debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/a-song-i-heard-the-ocean-sing>) \- Standard rendition until the jam takes a turn towards a beatless ambience drenched by Page's synth, which grows loosely percussive and upbeat. > to ""Drowned.""   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- A settled section follows the standard jam, which leads to some ""CYHMK""-like jamming, then some free form improvisation before returning to ""Twist"" to conclude.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- A very good jam eventually segues into a spacey interlude before ""2001"" kicks in.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
After Limb By Limb, Trey introduced Fish as ""Johnny B. Fishman"" and quoted
Johnny B. Goode, with Page also teasing ""Charge!"" before the quote. Split Open
and Melt included a Can't You Hear Me Knocking tease. Before the debut of The
Connection, Mike introduced Trey as ""Sweetie Pie"" and Trey responded by blowing
a kiss to Mike. There were severe thunderstorms during setbreak and, as a
result, Page made an announcement that they were going to take a longer than
usual break and that everyone on the lawn should return to their cars until the
second set, which would not start until 11:00.

[1] No whistling.  
[2] No intro.  
[3] Unfinished  
[4] Trey forgot an entire verse.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Wolfman's Brother](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/wolfmans-brother>) \- Really a great version that gets somewhat beyond the typical format with continued improvisation before coming home.   
  
[Walls of the Cave](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/walls-of-the-cave>) \- Straightforward until 12:55 when the jam breaks into a nice ""Type I"" outro jam. This jam settles briefly, then builds into a great ""Type II"" jam with some melodic licks from Trey that preview the catchy riff he seizes on in the following day's ""Ghost.""   
  
[A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/a-song-i-heard-the-ocean-sing>) \- Outstanding ""Type II"" version. The jam probes the sea floor until finding oceanic bliss around the 9:30 mark. Trey lays back crafting rhythmic textures, while Page deploys the clavinet. What follows is a calming sense of murky haze before the jam gains momentum, ultimately returning to the song proper. > to an exceptional ""Piper.""   
  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- A multi-section improvisational super heavyweight. The jam begins with a low-key, ""Piper""-like groove, settles, then builds into an angry and rocking section that eventually bursts into a ""Tweeprise"" Jam. From here, the jam settles into a couple of great and swinging, lower intensity grooves that -> to ""Jibboo.""   
  
[Limb By Limb](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/limb-by-limb>) \- A well played version. Following the typical ""Limb"" peak, there is a sort of celebratory, almost euphoric power jam that is both unusual and adds extra mustard to this ""Limb.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Reba did not have the whistling ending. Scents did not have the intro. Piper
featured a substantial Tweezer Reprise jam. Jibboo was unfinished. Trey forgot
an entire verse of Cavern. Cavern contained a Purple Haze tease.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Theme From the Bottom](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/theme-from-the-bottom>) \- Although essentially ""Type I,"" there is a high degree of melodic variation from Trey in this strong summer '95 version.   
  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Jamming both ethereal and measured builds from a pensive calm into a dreamy sort of intensity. Trey locks in upon a great, grooving theme. Strong work from Mike and Fish incites more fueled and focused soloing from Trey, which, offset by some impassioned Page, rises to a great release.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Dissonant version with a little brief funky Page action thrown in the mix before returning for a blistering peak.   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- -> in from ""Simple."" Cool, somewhat unusual jam that begins without all the usual thrashing and dissonance. Has some ""MLB""-like jamming and gets out there as it progresses.   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Beautiful opening segment.   
  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- Somewhat of an evil ""Possum"" that grows increasingly tense, dissonant and shrill, and includes an unusual stop.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey teased Call to the Post in Reba and Mind Left Body Jam in Bowie. This show
is available as an archival release on LivePhish.com.

Encore  : [ Free Bird ](<https://phish.net/song/free-bird>)

[1] Fish on acoustic guitar.  
[2] Acoustic and without amplification.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- The jam gets out there well beyond ""Stash."" The tension is cranked up repeatedly with great pounding by Fish.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Typically great '94 thrashing ""Antelope"" stuff until 6:25 when the jam breaks into a good settled section that percussively rebuilds with wild dissonance and buckets of tension.   
  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Strong, Mike-driven version, featuring great percussion. Trey's playing is as fast as Page's fills are delicate, and the band works through several ideas and progressions to build a jam that, at points, sounds like ""David Bowie.""   
  
[Makisupa Policeman](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/makisupa-policeman>) \- Excellent version. Reggae sounding and effects laden jam around 2:20 that goes on for a few minutes. A jam resembling a ""DDL"" jam (which doesn't actually include any loops) emerges around 6:30 out of the vocal reprise, and eventually works its way back into a second vocal reprise.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Suzy contained a tease of How Many More Times. Mike teased Manteca in Reba. Faht
featured Fish on acoustic guitar. My Sweet One was performed acoustic and
without amplification.

Encore  : [ Jesus Just Left Chicago ](<https://phish.net/song/jesus-just-left-chicago>)

[1] Vocal jam based on the word ""down.""  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[The Curtain With](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-curtain-with>) \- On this recording, Page is more prominent in the mix, which provides a nice audio record of his important role with this song. While The Curtain is generally tight, minor bumps here and there point to the difficulty of performing this highly composed section. The With jam begins with some nice, quiet interplay between Trey and Page. The jam gradually builds energy, but remains largely undulating and uplifting straight through to the downshifting conclusion.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Excellent jam that has a very bluesy feel to it, plus nimble and nasty guitar licks from Trey.   
  
[Jesus Just Left Chicago](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jesus-just-left-chicago>) \- Very soulful playing by Page, soaring guitar by Trey as the jam builds, and some great jazzy keyboard action.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
By request, extensive teasing of Iron Man preceded La Grange. The YEM vocal jam
was based on the word ""down"" and contained teases of When the Levee Breaks.
BBFCFM contained teases of the _Flintstones_ theme and London Bridge Is Falling
Down. This show is full of stage banter throughout, focused on the Dance Contest
that took place during BBFCFM and Swing Low, ""Art Funk"" and ""Foul, Reek and
Fecal."" ""Spunky Billington"" (Ninja Mike) & Magoo from Ninja Custodian won the
seemingly rigged dance contest and received the grand prize of Phish T-Shirts
and a $20 bill. The listing for the third set may be incomplete. Some copies of
this show in circulation are mislabeled as 6/18/88.

With no Fall tour this is the first time since they got back together that they haven't done a fall tour the year a new album came out,"Title is pretty much it. I thought it was kind of a fun stat.

Being a Phish Fan in Texas is depressing ,"Every couple of months nowadays, someone will go on here and ask the same old question: Why Won‚Äôt Phish do shows in Texas? And then they‚Äôll get flooded with a mixture of genuine answers and jokes about how Texas sucks and the band will not return any time soon.

I often ask that question as well, but as a relatively young person who just got into the band close to two years ago, I‚Äôve never seen them before. It is my dream to see these guys, but living in this shit hole is incredibly disappointing.
I understand why they won‚Äôt come, I‚Äôm OK if they don‚Äôt, but it just sucks not being able to travel in my current situation and just being stuck here. The real bummer is that I had plans in case they were going to do a Fall Tour, but those were put to rest, so I guess I have to wait longer.

I shouldn‚Äôt take it that hard. I‚Äôm very proud of where I come from, but I know Texas is not the best place for this band. I just don‚Äôt even know anymore.

[1] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Ruby Waves](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ruby-waves>) \- Debut. Compact, and coyly > from Halley's Comet, playful licks, a meandering, breezy, and open-ended feel following the main chorus, offers a glimpse of what soons becomes a signature, second set staple.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show marked the Phish debut of Ruby Waves. Mike teased Passing Through in
Stash. Trey teased Plasma in The Final Hurrah. Golden Age contained a Crosseyed
tease from Page, an I'm a Man (Spencer Davis Group) tease from Trey, and a Gotta
Jibboo tease from Mike.

**Show Notes:**  
  
This show contained the debut of Summer of '89. Possum contained a Streets of
Cairo tease by Trey and Reba did not have the whistling ending. Sleeping Monkey
was played for a fan who was holding up a sign for the song during the previous
show. Trey later said ""if the guy with the sign isn't here, everybody sing so he
can hear it on the tape,"" leading to the crowd to sing part of the song. Trey
said they were playing the second Tweezer Reprise because they didn't play one
at Hershey Park.

[1] Unfinished.  
[2] Aborted.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Tube](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tube>) \- A great 3.0 version with an extended clav solo from Page while Trey compliments him with funky rhythm playing and bent notes. Trey then takes the lead into the upper register. Later in the jam, Trey returns to rhythm playing and Page gets down on the MOOG.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the first Walk Away since October 5, 2000 (80 shows). Disease
was unfinished. After Grind, Trey remarked that Page blew the wrong note on the
pitch pipe and had them all singing in the wrong key. They decided to perform
another _a cappella_ song and Trey joked that if they couldn't get it right,
Fish would sing Bike. Sure enough, Hello My Baby was no better and was aborted.
However, true to his word, Trey announced that Fish will now sing Bike. For his
part, Fish took the opportunity to welcome everyone to ""the trainwreck portion
of the show."" Bike was played for the first time since September 12, 2000 (95
shows).

[1] Phish debut; Jay-Z on vocals and Cyro Baptista on percussion.  
[2] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Breaks away from ""CDT"" at about 6:00 and by 8:00 has morphed into a very subdued, quiet sentiment. The jam gradually rebuilds momentum and pulse and returns to ""CDT.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Scents and Subtle Sounds was teased prior to AC/DC Bag. This show contained the
Phish debuts of 99 Problems and Big Pimpin', both of which featured Jay-Z on
vocals and Cyro Baptista on percussion. After 99 Problems, Jay-Z remarked,
presumably referring to the Phish scene, that ""You all been hiding this from
me.""  Jay-Z then said that the members of Phish told him that if the fans made
enough noise that he could play one more song, which they naturally did, hence
Big Pimpin'. Prior to Hood, Trey jokingly announced an Eric Clapton guest
appearance. Mike teased Entrance of the Gladiators before Hood, which was
unfinished.

[1] Monty Python ""Spam"" vocal jam.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[It's Ice](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/its-ice>) \- Excellent version where the band really rocks out during the jam.   
  
[Divided Sky](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/divided-sky>) \- Fish handily takes first prize in this rhythmically (and otherwise) intense ripper from a hot show.   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Beautiful, descending four chord ""Mind Left Body Jam""-like progression in the hi-hat intro. ""Three Blind Mice""-like riffing segues into melodic hose, which in turn becomes a ""DEG""-flavored, thrilling jam. ""Voodoo Child"" and ""Purple Haze"" teases in closing segment.   
  
[Mind Left Body Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mind-left-body-jam>) \- -> in from ""DB."" A superb and melodic ""MLB"" Jam in the intro to ""Bowie."" -> back to ""DB.""   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- -> in from ""MLB"" Jam. From here, a spectacular '94 ""Bowie"" launches. A thrilling version of ""Bowie.""   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- Good ""Tweezer"" but check out this show as a whole...   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- ""Frankenstein"" and ""How Many More Times"" teases. ""SPAM"" VJ!!   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The Mind Left Body Jam's melodic theme (like the MLB theme from Grateful Dead
jams) bears a striking resemblance to Marvin Gaye's and Tammi Terrell's You're
All I Need To Get By. Bowie (after the MLB Jam) included Three Blind Mice,
Dave's Energy Guide, Voodoo Child, and Purple Haze teases. YEM included
Frankenstein and How Many More Times teases, as well as a Spam Song vocal jam
with a We're Off to See the Wizard quote (""Oz"" was changed to ""Spam""). The vocal
jam also contained a Point Me in the Direction of Albuquerque quote. Chalk Dust
subsequently contained a full band tease of How Many More Times. This show was
released as part of the _Chicago '94_ box set.

**Show Notes:**  
  
This performance was on Danny Bonaduce's radio show on WLUP 97.9 FM before
Phish's concert that evening at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago, IL. Sweet Adeline
was preceded by a eight second rendition of I Woke Up in Love and followed by a
nine second version of Point Me in the Direction of Albuquerque. Both I Woke Up
and Point Me were sung to the tune of Back in my Hometown and were a bit of a
Phish joke on Bonaduce as they were both songs from _The Partridge Family_ . Dog
Faced Boy was performed acoustic. This performance might be incomplete as the
interview after Dog Faced Boy is cut.

Fluffhead, Mercury, The Inlaw Josie Wales, Joy, Harry Hood, and First Tube

also appeared on Shade and Split Open and Melt. Alive Again was performed
acoustic for the first time since May 22, 2002. Everything's Right was started
and stopped with Trey getting up and acting like he was going to walk off stage
before sitting down and playing the song in full. Prior to Harry Hood, Trey sang
a bit of Rescue Squad after introducing the Strings.

Show Notes: ""At the Gazebo"" featured the Vermont Youth Orchestra String Quartet. During the
break before the encore maracas and tambourines were passed out to the audience
and a set of stairs was placed in front of the stage. During ""Alive Again""
approximately forty guests - including members of [Cyro Baptista][7]'s [Beat The
Donkey][8] ensemble, Brazilian dancers and other assorted percussionists and
pranksters - joined Trey's band in what can perhaps best be described as a
strange combination of two infamous Phish antics: the [10/22/96][9] MSG
""[Freakapaug][10]"" and the [5/27/94][11] ""Shake your Macaroni"" [Possum][12].
After the ending refrain and amid an audience-aided percussion jam, Trey led the
entire entourage down the stairs in front of the stage, through the audience and
onto 51st Street where a drum circle ensued, blocking midtown traffic for nearly
half an hour.

Show Notes: This private party jam session included Michael Bizar on guitar, Mark ""Murph""
Murphy on bass, Pete Herr on percussion, and Scott Bilstad, who along with Fish
played drums. A ninety-minute recording of this jam session does circulate and
includes ""Impressions,"" ""Whipping Post,"" and the _Sanford and Son_ theme; the
recording that does circulate is often mislabeled as a ""parking lot jam."" Phish
had performed [earlier in the evening][13] at the UIC Pavilion.

The Tale of Metal Tangle,"Trey said he might tell it someday but I‚Äôm impatient so I asked Google Gemini AI

Tell me the tale of metal tangle :


In the heart of a dying star, where gravity crushed elements into unimaginable density, the world of Metal Tangle was born. It wasn't a world forged in fire, but in pressure. Here, every mountain was a twisted extrusion of cobalt, every valley a trough of liquid silver. Life, if it could be called that, bloomed in the most unexpected ways.
The Ferron people, beings of living bronze, roamed the plains, their bodies ever-shifting and malleable. They built cities that defied gravity, their architecture a mesmerizing dance of interlocking gears and twisting pipes. High above, the Avians, creatures of polished chrome and clockwork wings, soared through the metallic sky.
But peace wasn't fated to last. The Core, a malevolent entity of pure obsidian, pulsed with a corrupting influence. It sent tendrils of dark iron that choked the land, twisted the bronze of the Ferron, and corrupted the Avians' clockwork hearts.The once vibrant world became a tapestry of decay and despair.
Then came the arrival of the Stella, a being of unknown origin. Her form shimmered with an otherworldly luminescence,a stark contrast to the oppressive metallic gloom. Legends say she fell from the heavens, a herald of hope. Her touch could mend the corrupted metal, her presence a beacon against the encroaching darkness.
The tale of Metal Tangle becomes fragmented here. Some say Stella rallied the Ferron and Avians, teaching them to fight back against the Core's corruption. Others claim she was a lone warrior, a shining star carving a path of light through the metallic wasteland.
What is known is that the fight continues. The world of Metal Tangle teeters on a precipice. Will the Stella's light pierce through the Core's darkness, or will the world succumb to the crushing weight of corruption? That, my friend, is a story yet to be written.

That being said, the fact that they have just ignored one of the 3 biggest states in the country, and perhaps the most isolated large state, is downright disrespectful. It‚Äôs absurd that we can‚Äôt get any shows down here, and can hardly get shows within 800 miles.

[2] No whistling.  
[3] Ending similar to Brother mixed in with normal DWD ending.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- Second jam is a journey down slankytown lane. Slow, with some stop-start funk. Go to Atlantic City for the shady off-Boardwalk atmosphere. Stay for this ""2001"".   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Jam gets unusually dissonant near the end, then there is more dissonance and noisy space and a > to ""Prince Caspian.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
For the fourth Father's Day in a row, Brother was performed and featured all of
the band's children on stage and subsequent introductions (which included a
""Charge!"" tease from Page). After Timber, Trey sang the ending notes to Brother.
Trey then said he had a tri question for the crowd and asked ""how many songs end
like this?"" and the band sang the ending of Brother again. He answered the
question by saying the songs were My Friend, My Friend, Rift, and Brother (all
of which had their endings ""sung""). Trey added that tonight was special because
from now on, Timber would also end with the Brother ending (which was sung
again). Trey said Page could also end Lawn Boy that way from now on, prompting a
Lawn Boy quote from Page. Mike then teased Ha Ha Ha. Trey went on to say that
Metallica would be playing at Bader Field soon after Phish and that he didn't
think they ended a single song like the ending of Brother (Trey sang the
ending). Trey said if everyone wrote Metallica a note saying ""Dear Metallica,
please end Master of Puppets like this"" (singing the ending one final time), if
they got 20,000 notes, they just might do it. Fluffhead and Down With Disease
subsequently had endings similar to Brother mixed in with their normal finishes.
Reba did not contain the whistling ending.

Encore  : [ Wilson ](<https://phish.net/song/wilson>) > [ Loving Cup ](<https://phish.net/song/loving-cup>)

[1] ""Play it, Leo!"" lyric replaced with ""Leo's House!""  
[2] No whistling.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Rock and Roll](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/rock-and-roll>) \- ""A Love Supreme"" tease is included in this outstanding version, which while subtle and spacey at times, is the ""good"" kind of musical space, requiring band-wide cohesion and coordinated improvisation. Segue to ""Ghost.""   
  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Pretty clean - and rather fast - playing through the composed section incites strong improvisation from Trey, who syncs up with Mike and Fish, who nicely modulate intensity. Great guitar - with Page painting bright fills - dominates a strong, patient, and highly musical build, with Trey trilling to a thrilling release.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
In NICU, the lyric ""Play it, Leo!"" was replaced with ""Leo's House!"" Scent of a
Mule contained a tease of The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana) from Page.
Trey and Mike wore identical T-shirts in the first set. Trey said he wouldn't
give away who was on their shirts, but said during the beginning of Mockingbird
that it was ""the famous mockingbird!"" (The face on the shirt was actually local
musician David Mayfield; Trey and Mike had apparently seen him the previous
night). The shirts were again referenced during Icculus, with the image showing
on the video screens and Trey saying it was written by the man on the screen.
The Rock and Roll jam featured a tease from Mike of A Love Supreme. Reba did not
contain the whistling ending. Bike was played for the first time since June 18,
2009 (100 shows). During his vacuum solo, Fish teased Over the Rainbow. After
his solo, Fish forgot the words to Bike, prompting the band to play HYHU. In the
soundcheck, Funky Bitch was briefly teased before Dog Log began.

Encore  : [ Shine a Light ](<https://phish.net/song/shine-a-light>)

[1] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Down with Disease](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/down-with-disease>) \- A very good clavinet-led funk groove develops. Briefly seems to be rebuilding to return to ""DwD"", but instead -> ""Sand.""   
  
[Farmhouse](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/farmhouse>) \- This version has an excellent jam segment most notable for the cohesive playing by all four band mates. The peaceful, wandering melody here creates a perfect soundtrack for a summer evening. The only drawback to this fine version is Trey's use of the pitch shifter, common throughout 2010, which can be grating if allowed to dominate one's listening experience.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Alaska contained a Streets of Cairo tease by Trey. Down With Disease was
unfinished.

[2] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/a-song-i-heard-the-ocean-sing>) \- Debut opens the Summer '04 Tour. The jam section is high energy, but also dark and gnarly, with great playing by Trey   
  
[The Moma Dance](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-moma-dance>) \- Strong but typical jam cools off gradually beginning around 9:20 and a cool, choppy jam emerges, that many fans may love. Transitions pleasantly but not magnificently into -> ""Free"".   
  
[Free](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/free>) \- -> in from an epic ""Moma Dance."" Sick bass by Mike. Maybe the best straightforward version. Great interplay by Trey and Mike.   
  
[46 Days](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/46-days>) \- Moves beyond ""46 Days"" into a swirling, more sedate segment. Jam then picks up a nice rhythmic pulse and great groove. The jam grows increasingly energized and intense, with a textbook -> to ""Possum.""   
  
[Suzy Greenberg](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/suzy-greenberg>) \- Multifaceted jam follows the final verse and refrain. At first rhythmic and plucky, it gradually becomes more intense, then grows slightly spacey, and intensifies again before finally settling with a > to ""Axilla.""   
  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- Second jam is what good 2.0 is all about: the band is locked in and the interplay is fresh and creates an environment for dancing hippies to flourish.   
  
[Weekapaug Groove](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/weekapaug-groove>) \- After a quick ""Mainstreet"" tease, the jam briefly settles before picking up a serious head of steam, transforming KeySpan Park in Brooklyn into a blistering and raging quick-tempo rock fest.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show was simulcast in movie theaters nationwide and subsequently officially
released in both CD and DVD formats as _Live In Brooklyn_ . This show marked the
debut of A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing and the Phish debut of Nothing. Kung was
dedicated to the golfers competing in the U.S. Open at the Shinnecock Hills Golf
Club in Southampton, NY. 46 Days included a DEG tease from Trey. San-Ho-Zay was
teased in 2001. Mike's Song featured a Twist tease. During Weekapaug, Trey
teased Mainstreet. Before the soundcheck's A Song I Heard The Ocean Sing,
Fluffhead, Frankenstein, Walls of the Cave, Seven Below, and Letter to Jimmy
Page were teased. At the end of the soundcheck, Trey teased Fluffhead, as
memorialized on the _Live in Brooklyn_ DVD.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Divided Sky](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/divided-sky>) \- 1995 was a very strong year for ""Divided Sky."" This show opening, sunset version is a case in point.   
  
[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- Great version that gets well beyond ""Stash"" into some serious dark exploration. Classic Summer '95 jamming. And a powerful ending to top it off.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- ""Heartbreaker"" tease, ""Johnny B. Goode"" sandwich. Although it contains some spacey jamming, it eventually becomes ferocious, with unbelievable, magnificent energy. Purported ""Montana"" tease.   
  
[Johnny B. Goode](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/johnny-b-goode>) \- -> in from ""Tweezer."" The debut of ""JBG"" is sandwiched in this ""Tweezer"" jam.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- -> in from ""Johnny B. Goode"" as this ""Tweezer"" continues and -> to ""McGrupp.""   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- Great summertime version includes some filthy, nasty Mike in the ""Mr. Minor"" section, Trey soloing by himself for several minutes, and a very powerful but non-shredding peak.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- Great version. Not overly improvisational, but the jam gets into a great power rocking groove beyond ""SOAM.""   
  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- The jam breaks into a different and repetitive groove early on, then returns to ""Gin"" in a very rocking manner.   
  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- OJ, OJ, and more OJ.   
  
[Simple](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/simple>) \- Entertaining version with ""OJ"" reference, plus they quoted ""Simple"" quite a bit in the ""Hydrogen"" (and ""Harpua"") of this show, too.   
  
[Weekapaug Groove](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/weekapaug-groove>) \- Very uplifting playing from Trey in this hot version from the ""OJ Show.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This is the infamous ""O.J. Show,"" played on the night of O.J. Simpson's Bronco
chase. 2001, Mike's, Simple, Poor Heart, and Harpua all included references to
O.J. Mike's Song also included a _Mission: Impossible_ theme _   _ tease and
Hydrogen included Simple quotes. Weekapaug contained a Nellie Kane tease from
Mike. Harpua included a Simple quote and Voodoo Child tease. This show is
available as an archival release on LivePhish.com.

played parts of Lawn Boy at a fast tempo before saying he was going to save that
one for when the ""boys"" come back and that they'd speed up Lawn Boy.

Question for those who partake‚Ä¶..,"If you are keen on adding an extraneous variable at Phish please read on.  This summer might be a triumphant return to something that is known to last 8-12 hours.  So I‚Äôm trying to decide what‚Äôs the optimal timing.

If I was camping and staying by the fire I‚Äôd just start around noon.  Ironically last year at Alpharetta N1 the wook next to me whipped out a 10 strip and offered me some during first song.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/light>) \- A fast break from ""Light"" -> to a quick rendition of ""Manteca."" Fantastic stuff. Remainder of the jam is Fish-driven and unlike another ""Light"" jam. There is quality ""Type I"" jamming as the band shreds over ""Manteca"" and ""Crosseyed"" teases.   
  
[Manteca](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/manteca>) \- -> in from ""Light."" Brief rendering of the Dizzy Gillespie classic occurs early in this ""Light"" jam. -> back to ""Light.""   
  
[Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/light>) \- -> in from ""Manteca"" as the strong ""Light"" jam really takes off in its aftermath.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Weekapaug contained a Nellie Kane tease from Trey. The Horse was quickly aborted
with Trey saying instead of playing Horse, he started thinking about how stupid
the ending to My Friend, My Friend was and it threw him off. Fish said that he
thought the ending was the greatest ending in rock history, that he loved it,
and it was his favorite ending. The ending of My Friend, My Friend was then
quoted. Trey said Maze was his personal favorite, prompting quick teases of the
end of Maze by himself and Page. Trey asked Page what his favorite song ending
was and Page responded with Lawn Boy, which the band subsequently played. Possum
contained Lawn Boy and Stash teases. Light contained a Manteca tease from Page
and Crosseyed and Painless quotes. Sand and GTBT also contained Crosseyed and
Painless quotes.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Halley's Comet](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/halleys-comet>) \- Although the jam doesn't stray too far from the basic ""Halley's"" structure until the final few spacey minutes, it is nonetheless a good quality version that segues nicely to ""Runaway Jim.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Reba did not have the whistling ending. Trey and Fish teased Seven Below before
Halley's Comet.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Limb By Limb](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/limb-by-limb>) \- Great show opening version settles into a relaxed, groove-like section while retaining the ""LxL"" vibe. The jam then patiently builds to a shredding, celebratory conclusion.   
  
[Runaway Jim](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/runaway-jim>) \- Excellent, multi-part ""Jim."" A serene yet percussive groove emerges first, followed by a transition with delay bombs dropping. Then Trey hits the mini-keyboard for a plunky, unusual jam before space and a -> to a very good ""Theme.""   
  
[Theme From the Bottom](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/theme-from-the-bottom>) \- -> in from ""Runaway Jim."" The jam has a very relaxed feel to it and some typical '00 sounds from Trey. At about 7:30, a droning, Fish and Gordon section begins. Trey adds some high pitched effects, and at 11:25, Page plays the chords signaling the impending conclusion. A gradual cycle down leads to a -> to ""Dog Faced Boy.""   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- Extended intro with awesome jazzy Mike and possibly a ""Dog Log"" tease. You might expect a really gentle, spacey jam given the year, but thanks to Fish, it has a really great pulse while also being delicate at first, swelling to nice peak.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Reba was preceded by a brief Bowie tease. This show is available as an archival

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- > in from the rocking debut of ""I Don't Care,"" the jam, here, offers a stark contrast. Trey works great, melodic soloing into a beautiful passage of quiet restraint, Page's fills matching the ""Doc's"" warm tone. Trey, via an impressive array of styles and ideas, slowly rebuilds intensity, and the band enters an unusual, somewhat funky jam, before arriving at a sudden conclusion. Cool version.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
I Don't Care made its short-lived debut at this show. Reba did not have the
whistling ending.

[1] Boyd Tinsley on fiddle.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Esther](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/esther>) \- The watery sounds produced by Trey's use of the Leslie percoloate throughout this great version. Add fantastic Page and Fish, with his uncharacteristic rim shots, and an unusual and highly engaging concluding Trey solo, and it adds up to a stellar performance.   
  
[It's Ice](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/its-ice>) \- Beautiful piano soloing by Page.   
  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- Starts tamely enough, but the tension and exploration improve as the jam progresses, and the ending is nuts.   
  
[Runaway Jim](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/runaway-jim>) \- Intense, psychedelic and incredibly improvisational version. Has similarities in the final 10 minutes to the Providence ""Bowie."" Oddly, seems unheralded among the canon of all-time, must-hear jams. -> to ""Free.""   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- ""Oye Como Va"" teases. Boyd from Dave Matthews Band on fiddle for part of the jam.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Halley's Comet was preceded by ""Charge!"" teases from Trey. Dog Faced Boy was
preceded by several false starts of Split Open And Melt by Fish. YEM featured
Boyd Tinsley on fiddle for a portion of the jam. The YEM vocal jam contained a
Lovin' You (Minnie Riperton) quote from Fish.

[Gumbo](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/gumbo>) \- First version with the honky-tonk, Page-solo coda. (They'd reworked the song before its 1994 debut.)   
  
[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- A belligerent, aggressive, volatile, and bad-ass jam. If you like the really sick versions of ""Stash,"" you're in for a treat.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- This is a super-charged, full-throttle version with strong playing by Page and Fish.   
  
[Down with Disease](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/down-with-disease>) \- The first ""Type II"" version in which the jam almost immediately breaks away into a rhythmic and rocking groove before settling into some good quieter space.

**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey sang the verses of Fee through a megaphone. Gumbo was played for the first
time since April 21, 1993 (104 shows). Disease contained a Swingtown tease and

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Timber (Jerry the Mule)](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/timber-jerry-the-mule>) \- Incredible Trey. And Page's keys lend added menace to this tense and harrowing early masterpiece. This Mule bites with a vengeance!   
  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- The beginning of this excellent jam is unusual and in minor key. Version released on Live Bait Vol. 5.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Kick-Ass version that rages but is also very improvisational. Mike and Trey rock.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Ya Mar was dedicated to Heather Paul on her birthday.  Mike played Happy
Birthday in the beginning of Ya Mar, Trey briefly teased Happy Birthday in Suzy

Last night they played 7/13/94 (Big Birch) in all its glory including that second set Cavern intro > Wilson (played in the style of Cavern) > Cavern. It was a small but mighty crowd at the venue and the band absolutely brought the heat. Excellent players all around, lead by guitarist Cal Kehoe from Pink Talking Phish. Apparently they debuted at Nectar‚Äôs in March. I can‚Äôt wait to see these guys again!",version Dark Star

Essential 3.0/4.0 Listening,"Long time listener of the band, mostly hover around the 90s era (currently working my way through August 93). Seeing them for the first time at Mondegreen.

6/14/00 Appreciation Post,"Twenty-four years ago, the band played what many (including myself) consider to be their best show: 6/14/00 in Fukuoka, Japan.

Smack dab in the middle of their Japan tour, six months after their epic Big Cypress show, and just a few months before their first hiatus, the show highlights a band exhausted but still full of ideas and willing to take their music to new and interesting places.

Listening to this show, it's hard to find anyone playing ""lead"" in the normal sense. There is no ego in the playing, it is simply four men patiently listening to each other and responding to what they hear. The 2nd set seems subdued on paper but listening back you can hear 17 years of comraderie and experience in four songs. The opening Back on the Train suggests great things to come but it's the Twist->Walk Away->2001 that steals the show. 

People sometimes sleep on the 1st set here but that is also full of fantastic music. The Cities and Gumbo are some of the finest versions of those songs while the set closing SOaM is a personal favorite of mine. 

If you have not listened to this show yet, take some time today to give it a spin. If you are familiar with this show, you know that no write-up can do it justice and are probably already on your way to give it your Nth listen.

[Tube](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tube>) \- Strong 3.0 version with start-stop jamming and fantastic playing from Mike as per usual. Spacey outro into ""Cities"".   
  
[Birds of a Feather](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/birds-of-a-feather>) \- Following a good straightforward ""Birds"" jam, this one moves beyond ""BOAF"" proper into an upbeat, pulsing jam. From there, it shifts again into 3.0-style ambient space, before regaining some rhythm and -> to ""BOTT.""   

  
**Show Notes:**

[1] Unfinished; song (and set) had to be stopped mid-stream due to a strong
incoming thunderstorm.  
[2] Started mid-song after the rain delay (set break).  
[3] Lyrics changed to reference the weather.  
[4] A cappella.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Foam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/foam>) \- Strong group play during Page's riveting solo, followed by a nice handoff to Trey who leads the boys in an inspired build-up.   
  
[Timber (Jerry the Mule)](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/timber-jerry-the-mule>) \- The band powers through this version with added verve and tenacity. Trey's intense playing is particularly on-point, the jam arriving at a bona fide peak before boiling over and cooling down.   
  
[Julius](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/julius>) \- The band does a nice job here of bringing the jam down nice and low, before raising it back up high at the end.   
  
[Gotta Jibboo](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/gotta-jibboo>) \- Clean and fast playing, gorgeous interplay from all band members, super clean and happy peak. Nice jazzy accidentals at the peak help with tension and release, especially when it hits the last and highest peak. Some light, airy, and rapid playing - more so than usual in 3.0 - from Trey in the peak.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Mound was unfinished and the set had to be stopped mid-stream due to a strong
incoming thunderstorm. Prior to leaving the stage, Trey introduced his guitar
tech, Brian Brown. Trey also repeatedly said ""Storm"" several times and then,
apparently referring to a sign that a fan was holding, said ""we will play that
song but not tonight because we don't know it. And that's the honest truth. One
of these days."" To open set two, Mound was started mid-song, more or less where
the band had left off to close set one. Tweezer's lyrics were changed to
reference the weather. Funky Bitch contained Birdwatcher teases. Kung was
performed _a cappella._

Encore  : [ Gotta Jibboo ](<https://phish.net/song/gotta-jibboo>)

[1] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[AC/DC Bag](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/acdc-bag>) \- The jam portion is straightforward, but slowed to a really pleasant, mellow groove.   
  
[Ghost](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ghost>) \- Generally patient deconstruction of the ""Ghost"" theme that veers into Albany ""YEM"" (""Oh Happy Day"") jamspace for a few then resolves to glorious peak that leaves you asking ""Why doesn't Phish jam the fuck out of songs in the first set ever anymore?"" [A quality '00-style ""Ghost"" groove rolls along, breaks into great swinging section, and then cranks it up into some serious hose-jamming before returning to ""Ghost.""]   
  
[Down with Disease](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/down-with-disease>) \- The jam breaks into a nice rhythmic groove around 11:40, with great Fish and Mike. Around 18:00, Trey jumps to the keyboards, and then it gets, well, weird. Similar to 12/12/95, it's very exploratory, but perhaps not transcendent music.   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Very odd, atypical Trey noodling in the jam. Weird version to be sure. The B&D; starts up meekly, but then dies out to nothing quickly. And eventually out of the nothing (silence), there's barely audible vocal jamming, that increases in volume... and they end the VJ by harmonizing on the word ""Puppies."" (Trey tries not to laugh) Must hear? You be the judge.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Ghost contained a Live and Let Die tease from Mike and Oh Happy Day teases from
Trey. Disease included a Birdland tease and was unfinished. Bike was preceded by
a vacuum solo and followed by several runs through the HYHU theme, with each
faster than the one before it. The soundcheck's The Happy Whip and Dung song
contained lyrics and Windora Bug included alternate ""we got really drunk last
night"" lyrics and a Lively Up Yourself tease from Mike.

[1] Unfinished.  
[2] Slower fashion; Fish on trombone, Mike on electric drill, and Trey on
megaphone.  
[3] Chanting of ""Send me on my way.""  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- Psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat as the tension ratchets up. Unfinished with a -> to ""IDK.""   
  
[I Didn't Know](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/i-didnt-know>) \- Segues in smoothly from Stash. This unusual version is played much slower than normal and carries real weight. The bizarre jam in the middle features Fishman on trombone and Mike on power drill.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- A good thriller. Not as improvisational and exploratory as many '93s and '94s, but this one compensates with riveting tension.   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- ""Bowie"" picks up right where it left off in Providence, and summer '95 includes a number of spectacular, ""Big"" versions. This first one, while sticking to the ""Bowie"" theme longer than most, is exploratory both within that framework, and certainly once it gets beyond.   
  
[Slave to the Traffic Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/slave-to-the-traffic-light>) \- Some great playing by Trey throughout, and Fish seems to quicken the tempo as the jam progresses to add dynamism.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Stash was unfinished and melted into I Didn't Know, which was performed in an
eerie, slower fashion and featured Fish on trombone, Mike on electric drill for
the first time, and Trey on megaphone. Antelope contained a Voodoo Child tease
from Trey. Bowie included some odd chanting, including the phrase ""Send me on my
way"" (although not in a manner similar to the Rusted Root song of the same
name).

[Whipping Post](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/whipping-post>) \- After starting ""Antelope,"" Trey says ""Aw Fuck That!"" Good call. The first jam is predictably intense. The second is more restrained, with Page switching keyboards, Mike sounding like Berry Oakley, and Trey only gradually bringing the heat. Great quiet before the final storm - 14:35 - 15:35.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
I Didn't Know featured Fish on trombone and contained a Hands Across America
quote from Trey. It's possible that Anarchy may have been played after I Didn't
Know, as Trey called for it, but there is a cut in the recording. After the cut,
Trey said ""that was a special request for our friend Steve Dolley"" and jokingly
quoted Hello, Dolly! This show marked the first known performance of Contact;
Contact lyrics were also sung during Dear Mrs. Reagan. 'A' Train contained
London Bridge Is Falling Down and _Brady Bunch_ theme teases. Whipping Post
began as Antelope. The actual date of this show may have been June 16, 1988.

Goose the ‚Äònew phish‚Äô argument ,Obviously phish is more composed. A lot of their classic tunes are literally built for an orchestra on treys behalf. But what gets me is that when phish first started to make headway in the early to mid 90s‚Ä¶everyone compared them to the dead because of their compositions leading into lengthy jams. And I feel as if phans nowadays (especially 1.0ers with my personal experience) do the same with goose and phish. Maybe it‚Äôs a history repeats itself type of deal. I will always pick phish over any jam band. But I know this is a serious debate in the jam scene. Especially after treys endorsement with goose regarding the tab/goose tour in November 2022.

[Everything's Right](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/everythings-right>) \- A hidden gem in a stand-alone festival set. Buried 9 minutes in is an abrupt but welcome left turn to blissier grooves, and multiple pleasant and sizable peaks unfold on the back of Mike's rolling bass. At 11:20, a thematic tone poem introduced by Trey builds up to a sustain-drenched peak.

**Show Notes:**  
  
This show, performed on the What Stage, closed out the 2009 Bonnaroo Festival.
Before Mustang Sally, Trey remarked that he had seen a show at Jadwin Gym at
Princeton University when was 12 (apparently referring to a 11/1/78 performance
by Bruce Springsteen at this 3,000 seat venue, though Trey would have been 14 at
the time), and added that Phish would now have an opportunity to play with one
of his heroes, Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen joined in on guitar and vocals for
Mustang Sally, Bobby Jean and Glory Days. Mustang Sally was played for the first
time since August 5, 1988 (1,280 shows). This show marked the Phish debuts of
Bobby Jean and Glory Days. Limb By Limb contained a Dave's Energy Guide tease.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Carini](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/carini>) \- Jam begins in customary skull rattling mode, but then breaks into a nice groove laid down by Mike and Fish.   
  
[Cities](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/cities>) \- Very serene and mellow version from a highly regarded show.   
  
[Gumbo](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/gumbo>) \- Jam starts spacey before finding its groove. They ride it out before Mike picks up the pace with Fish quickly responding. Trey plays some heavy rock and roll chords before they segue into ""Llama"".   
  
[Back on the Train](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/back-on-the-train>) \- With a rolling, funky groove that stays close to the standard structure, this is the first truly jammed-out version that sets up nicely for a 35 minute ""Twist."" Lots of improvisation within a narrow groove.   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- MUST-HEAR 2-part ""Twist."" Part I (""Twist"" 18:01) departs into a beautiful and peaceful groove at 5:30. The tension builds, then recedes back to serene bliss before returning to ""Twist."" Part II (""Jam"" 16:20) begins with eerie and spacey effects, then gradually builds into an intergalactic groove that gets better and better and -> to ""Walk Away.""   
  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- Part II (""Jam"") of a MUST-HEAR, 34 minute ""Twist"" begins with eerie and spacey effects, then gradually builds into an intergalactic groove that gets better and better and -> to ""Walk Away.""   
  
[Walk Away](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/walk-away>) \- -> in from an incredible ""Twist"" > ""Jam"" combo. The outro of the typical version morphs into more serene, unprecedented, and intergalactic improvisation. Very gradually, this unique jamming builds some energy, rolling percussion, and blasts off (->) to ""2001.""   
  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- Trippy intro from ""Walk Away"". This ""2001"" is all killer and no filler. Liquid Nitrogen Mike mixes with the rest of band and spits out fire.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey altered the lyrics in Cities to reference noodles. Gumbo contained a
Mystery Achievement tease from Mike. Fee included a tease of the Oriental Riff
from Fish, who played it on the woodblock during one of his breaks. Trey teased
Streets of Cairo in Split Open and Melt. The jam between Twist and Walk Away
included a segment based on the intro to Ghost. Sleep was played by request.
This show was officially released as _Live Phish 04_ . The soundcheck's Funky
Bitch contained Spanish Moon teases from Mike.

[2] Debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Free](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/free>) \- The new or modern ""Free"" jam is hatched with funky, bass-led sound. Great Page on clavinet, organ, synthesizer and piano.   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- Debut. Straightforward jam structure, but includes a nice funky Page-led section beginning about 6:00.   
  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- Debut in Dublin. Many '97 - '99 versions follow this format, that involves (1) a long, harmonic, building intro, (2) a high energy lyrics and ""Type I"" jamming section, and (3) a short settling coda, but no exploratory jamming or improvisation.   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Strong playing by Fish helps this fiery and tempestuous one get outside the box several times.   
  
[Cavern](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/cavern>) \- A low-key but VERY funky ""Cavern."" Check it out!   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the debuts of Bye Bye Foot, Twist, Piper, and Waking Up and
the Phish debuts of Dirt and Saw It Again. This show also featured unusually
improvisational versions of Waste and Cavern. Bowie included a full band Dave's
Energy Guide tease.

Pierre in Possum. This 50+ minute Tweezer included a brief Gypsy Queen jam, a
Digital Delay Loop Jam with whistling, and an Also Sprach Zarathustra tease from
Trey. Simple contained a Jump Monk tease from Trey and was performed with an _a
cappella_ ending instead of a jam, akin to the _A Live One_ version from
December 8, 1994. Amazing Grace was performed without microphones. In the
soundcheck, Funky Bitch was peformed as a slow version and Rift was played as an
instrumental. This show is available as an archival release on LivePhish.com.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- ""On Broadway"" jam!   
  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- Intense, with ""DEG""-like jamming from 5:15 - 5:50, awesome Fish, and an ""On Broadway"" tease at the start of the jam.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
After The Asse Festival segment of Guelah, the band launched into Adeline and
then moved into a Digital Delay Loop Jam before finishing the song. Adeline was
performed without microphones. Trey sang the verses of Fee through a megaphone.
My Sweet One was performed acoustic without microphones. YEM included On
Broadway teases in both the jam and the vocal jam; it was also teased during
Possum. Entrance of the Gladiators was also teased in the YEM vocal jam. HYHU
segued out of the YEM vocal jam and included Fish talking about how much he
hates that song (though he has nothing personal against Argent, who wrote it).
Possum also included Dave's Energy Guide teases.

But when someone asks what's the worst Phish show it's always 10/25/16 right after Coventry. And after listening to hundreds of shows I agree that both of them are stinkers. Weak song selection and always staying in type 1 territory. I think night one at least had the killer ""I always wanted it this way"", which made it more forgettable. But night two was so bad that people remembered it for that sole reason.

Like I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôd be too much of a shock? 

An album like Sigma Oasis or Big Boat would have certainly shocked a 1.0 fan, but on Joy you have plenty of catchy uptempo ragers (BDTNL and Light among others), straight ahead dark blues rock guitar heroism (Stealing Time), classic Phish humour (I Been Around) and a sweeping rock-orchestral opus to close the album off (even if I don‚Äôt like that one very much.) To the ears of this 3.0 fan it really doesn‚Äôt sound like something that would‚Äôve been bemoaned (it‚Äôs more or less the formula of Billy Breathes to my ears and people LOVE Billy Breathes) but I‚Äôm making this post to hear it from the horse‚Äôs mouth. 

What was the reaction through 2009 to the Joy material? What were the favored songs (if there were any)? Which ones were hated? Which ones felt overplayed and which felt overlooked? Were people optimistic about Phish‚Äôs direction or did it really seem as dad-rocky as their later albums would become? Or any other observations about the fan spirit around the release of Joy and into the 2009 tours.",Phans followed Phish reaction Backwards Number Line well Joy

[1] Unfinished.  
[2] Older, alternate lyrics and a drawn-out, feedback-enhanced ending.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Ya Mar](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ya-mar>) \- A very serene, ethereal but structurally straightforward version, with the volume almost inaudibly low in the final minutes. Quite similar in vibe to much of the highly acclaimed show from the following day.   
  
[Fast Enough for You](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/fast-enough-for-you>) \- Very slow, very patient, extraordinarily soulful version.   
  
[Mike's Song](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mikes-song>) \- The jam in ""Mike's"" often became heavily groove oriented in 2000. Here, the band locks into a stormy and brooding Mike-led jam, which becomes increasingly rocking and powerful.   
  
[Weekapaug Groove](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/weekapaug-groove>) \- The jam gets into a nice, low-key ""Type I"" groove with great Mike and Fish, followed by a spirited conclusion when it shifts back to the ""Weekapaug"" standard.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Cavern included the older, alternate lyrics and a drawn-out, feedback-enhanced
ending. Mike's Song ended with a Peaches en Regalia tease from Fish. Before
Jibboo and after Wolfman's the band teased Is She Really Going Out with Him? The
audience sang along at one point and tried in vain to convince Phish to play the
song in its entirety. Antelope was unfinished - Mike segued into a funky version
of Contact right before the ""Rye, Rye, Rocco"" lyric segment.

[3] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Limb By Limb](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/limb-by-limb>) \- Debut. Band sounds a little shaky trying to get this new song right, especially Fish with the complex rhythm.   
  
[Vultures](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/vultures>) \- Played twice during ""Bradstock"" (6/6/97), ""Vultures"" properly debuts in Dublin, a month before the band's historic 1997 summer tour. While the song will be reworked over the coming years, its essential elements are place, namely super intra-band improvisation, working within the ""context"" of the song's form, framed, in large part, by incredible percussion and rhythmic variation.   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Jam breaks into a nice funky-but-rockin' groove. Unfinished with -> to ""Ghost.""   
  
[Ghost](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ghost>) \- Cursory initial inspection of form and function...healthy purr from the motor...let's rev this thing up. [Debut.]   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Phish continued their tradition of breaking out new songs at the beginning of a
tour; Trey announced after Dogs Stole Things that the band had written 15-16 new
songs in the last eight weeks and that they would be debuting many of them at
this show. The show featured the debuts of Dogs Stole Things, Limb By Limb,
Wading in the Velvet Sea, Water in the Sky, Vultures, Ghost, and Oli's Pool as
well as the Phish debuts of Stand! and Izabella. Stash was preceded by a Tequila
tease. Chalk Dust was unfinished. Character Zero included a Jean Pierre tease
from Trey.

Encore  : [ Sweet Adeline ](<https://phish.net/song/sweet-adeline>) ^2  , [ Julius ](<https://phish.net/song/julius>)

[1] No whistling.  
[2] Without microphones.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Foam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/foam>) \- Some great plucking and strumming by Trey. The band is so tight and locked on in this version.   
  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Really cool and experimental playing from the jump. Trey scratches his way into the jam and synchs up with Mike to exchange a cool set of complimentary notes. This builds into a series of measured, effects-enhanced chords, and great full-band play, featuring quiet, contemplative exploration, and marked rhythmic shifts. Trey's soloing dazzles, as the band works to a characteristically strong peak.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Reba did not have the whistling ending. Chalk Dust contained Purple Haze and DEG
teases. This version of Golgi, according to Trey, was the ""jazz version."" Sweet
Adeline was performed without microphones as Trey jokingly tried to break the
record for the largest venue played without mics.

Encore  : [ Golgi Apparatus ](<https://phish.net/song/golgi-apparatus>)

[1] Acoustic and without amplification.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Esther](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/esther>) \- Totally on point, Trey moves the band though this version with verve and tenacity. Instead of modifying his tone, Trey dances through a series of notes, providing a solo not wholly unique (this is not the only of its kind), but perhaps the finest of its nature. A ""heavy metal"" outro of sorts befits this fine, ""exploratory"" ""Esther.""   
  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Trey scratches his way into the jam and incites an incredibly infectious groove. Fish works counter as means to inform the beat, and, as Trey begins to play proper, the theme remains the same, and the result is sweet. Page offers perfect fills, while Mike creates a somewhat strange and discordant line (which Trey assumes for several measures), before the band breaks to shape a really unique conclusion which morphs into a totally euphoric release.   
  
[Slave to the Traffic Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/slave-to-the-traffic-light>) \- Thrilling, intense, and very spirited conclusion to this ""Slave.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Ginseng Sullivan was performed acoustic, without amplification. The encore was
preceded by a Voodoo Child tease.

Reviews are not encouraging, but it's 1/3rd the cost of the Embassy Suites. 

Embassy lets you drink for free before the shows, and has complimentary breakfast, but there's no way I'm drinking and breakfasting $900 in 5 nights. Super 8 is also 8 minutes walking to a pot shop and 4 to a liquor store. I just don't want to die while walking there. ",Hotel Options

What happened in 2022? The more I listen to this three year span, the more 2022 becomes an outlier - and not in a good way. 21 was obviously a great year, and to my ears a lot of 2023 (especially spring tour) was awesome. But 2022 was really a lot of meh. Not a crazy number of epic jams, a lot of sloppy playing on routine songs, even Fishman stopped singing on Moma Dance for a while. Then they completely turned it around in 2023 and picked up right where 21 left off. What do you guys think was the problem in 22, or am I nuts?",vs vs
Mondegreen passes: will call to delivery,"Hi everyone. I bought two 4-day passes to the Mondegreen festival earlier this year and selected Will Call as the delivery method. Sadly I recently learned I will be unable to attend after all. I'd like to change the delivery method to actual delivery to allow me to sell the tickets at a discounted rate. Has anyone here done this successfully? Both the venue and the ticket vendor are telling me to sort it out with the other, so I hoped I might be able to find someone here who has had experience making this change. If anyone knows anything, I would really appreciate any information you have to share (who I should contact, etc)!

I'm sad I can't make it, and the prospect of eating the cost is...not helping lol. But I understand that is indeed a possibility. Thanks yall.

Camping at Bethel Woods vs Yasgur Road,"Seeing the guys at Bethel Woods this summer! First timers at the venue. We grabbed car camping and shuttle passes over at Yasgur Road ‚Äì it seemed like a cool place to stay. The only thing is, do they allow in and out in terms of cars? How was your experience with the shuttles to and from Yasgur Road? 

Then we saw today that tent camping at the venue was available. Thinking it would be nice to not have to shuttle! Anybody had experience or preference for either?

More importantly which is in closer proximity to Shakedown?!

What would it take for Phish Inc to tell Livenation and Ticketmaster to kiss their ass?,"We all saw Pearl Jam try this in vain, so one group won't have enough pull.  And even though the DOJ has a potential ""breakup"" in the works, I don't place a ton of faith in a government entity that will probably just fine them and have the DOJ (conflict of interest?) or SEC pocket the money.  This does us no good.  But what if we had a United Nations of touring acts that banded together against them?  T-Swift has kicked up the dust and said no to ""dynamic pricing"", how many artists would it take to make a significant impact?  Below are some of the top grossing touring acts of the last five years:

* Ed Sheeran
* Taylor Swift
* The Rolling Stones
* Beyonc√© and Jay-Z (The Carters)
* U2
* Coldplay
* Bruno Mars
* Elton John
* Drake
* Justin Bieber

If they formed a legal entity and coalition together, it could potentially shelter them from any major blow-back of breaching contracts.  The end goal, in my humble opinion, would be to cap costs of a single ticket and make sure that tickets go to fans and not bots or brokers.  In the event this couldn't be accomplished, how possible could it be for these major artists to launch their own ticketing service that would be in-house?  People in the live music business, this is your time to chime in.  Phish and their fans have been the catalyst for concert streaming and for net neutrality, who's to say ticket sales can't be next?

Edit\* It sounds like trying to eliminate Premium/Platinum tickets and choosing to enforce face value resell only would be the easiest option and least friction for the band.

Edit 2\* People who are referencing Pearl Jam again are hilarious, yes they obviously tried and failed.

Edit 3\* This post has obviously put a bee in some people's bonnet.  The amount of folks who are sticking up for the platinum ticket prices and saying Phish Inc owes us nothing in regards to these tickets are full of shit.  We all saw how the Sphere regular sales went...  I'm not saying some seats shouldn't cost more than others, just that there should be a cap that is reasonable ($200, $300?), and resellers limited to face values.  They could at least make an attempt...",would take Phish Inc tell Livenation Ticketmaster kiss

Did anyone have issues with the Conrad hotel package at the Sphere?,"Edit, they just got back to us. Didn't reach out to anyone else. Offered us a complimentary night. Regardless, what a huge pain in the ass.

100x has been trying to resolve the issue, but I think they can't really help at this point. Hotel said they would refund our stay based on the issues we had. Basically, our hotel room key didn't work when we got back the first night. Hotel wouldn't let me get a card even though it was under my name. So my wife goes and waits in line. This is over an hour just to get into the room after N1.

Hotel staff comes in at 9am to clean the room. Weird, but whatever. Then the manager comes by and says the room is marked as vacant. We try to sort it out with the front desk many many times. Both our room keys would quit working multiple times a day and then we'd be back at the front desk.

Anyways. We've been back and forth with 100x regarding the package, but the Conrad just takes a message with our info and never reaches back out, but told 100x they have. We've emailed directly and nothing comes of it. Probably wasted 6-8 hrs of our trip standing in line and explaining the room we were in that our cards are demagnetized, it's a computer error.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Loving Cup](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/loving-cup>) \- The longest ""Loving Cup"" to date is a clever - if not forced - nod to a Stanley Cup win for the St. Louis Blues minutes before this jam. A quiet bounce led by Page's piano and fast rotary tone from Trey explores quiet space at first. A rhythmic plinko jam follows, with Page on Wurlitzer and Fish's wood blocks providing occasional accent. At 7:15, Trey hints at a shift from minor to major key tonality, although the band winds back down into the patient rhythmic shuffle. Finally, at 8:45 Trey plays a few trills and Page switches to synthesizer, as a deserved - though again, if not forced - peak matches the elation of the city's first NHL championship. Whale call and twinkly Rhodes dominate the forefront of the peak, which winds down to > ""Twist.""   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- What begins as a relaxed and conversational groove shifts noticeably after 5 minutes growing eventually into a rhythm section powered freight train as Trey's melodic lines thicken becoming path clearing guitar blasts that lead to peak and return.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the Phish debuts of Gloria (Laura Branigan) and About to Run.
Trey teased Gloria in Run Like an Antelope and Suzy Greenberg. The second set
opened with Gloria (the St. Louis Blues won the Stanley Cup during setbreak and
Gloria had become the team's victory song during the season). Twist contained
Woman From Tokyo teases from Page. Trey teased Dave's Energy Guide in Light. The
Final Hurrah was quoted in First Tube.

[Boogie On Reggae Woman](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/boogie-on-reggae-woman>) \- Patient segue out of ""Wolfman's Brother."" Mike drops one of his ground-shaking bombs at 4:10. Great playing from Trey and Page in the outro jam before the > into ""Gumbo.""   
  
[Steam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/steam>) \- Very soulful Trey solo, and an extended ending.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Backwards Down the Number Line](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/backwards-down-the-number-line>) \- Excellent ""Type II"" version which starts to break away from ""BDTNL"" at 5:30 in a rocking and upbeat direction. At 8:30, the jam shifts into an ominous, dark Mike-led groove with great playing by Fish and Page as well as Mike.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Look Out Cleveland and Instant Karma! made their Phish debuts at this show.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Kill Devil Falls](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/kill-devil-falls>) \- The first ""Type II"" version. Led by Trey, the jam slowly drifts from the typical blues-rock into a whammy-filled, major-key groove not unlike the famous 7/10/99 ""CDT"" in spots. Ends with a -> to ""Free.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show marked Phish's first appearance at Bonnaroo. This ""late-night set"" on
the What Stage began at approximately 11:00 p.m. Highway to Hell was played for
the first time since February 26, 1997 (327 shows). YEM contained a brief Salt
Peanuts (aka Basie Boogie) tease from Page.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- At around 8:00, the jam shifts away from the typical into a pleasant major mode section. From there, a synth/keyobard-led section morphs into cool, groovy music with nice Page/Trey interplay. The energy builds becoming more rocking, until finally returning to ""Stash"" proper.   
  
[Tube](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tube>) \- After an appropriately funky opening, things relax a bit with Mike making his presence known melodically and Page supplying the now-ubiquitous samples of ""The Final Hurrah"" while Trey lays back. Later Trey reasserts himself with some striking soloing as the energy picks up towards the jam's conclusion.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the Phish debut of Drift While You're Sleeping. Trey teased
Plasma before Stash. Trey teased Gloria (Laura Branigan) in Theme From the
Bottom. The Final Hurrah was quoted in Tube and at the end of Character Zero.
Page teased The Very Long Fuse in NMINML. Piper contained a Rhapsody in Blue
tease. Trey and Page teased We're Off to See the Wizard in Limb By Limb.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Limb By Limb](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/limb-by-limb>) \- Well-played, not spectacular, but nevertheless features a cool and unusual vocal jam at the end - perhaps of S. African inspiration (performance occurred during the 2010 World Cup soccer finals in S. Africa).   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
After Possum, Trey congratulated the hometown Chicago Blackhawks' victory over
his beloved Philadelphia Flyers in the Stanley Cup Finals that ended two days
before this show. Reba was performed without the whistling ending. Limb By Limb
included an ending vocal jam. Trey teased San-Ho-Zay in Ghost. Antelope
contained a Dave's Energy Guide tease by Trey in the intro section. Antelope
subsequently contained a Fish drum solo. ""Jon Fishman"" was substituted for
""Marco Esquandolas"" and Antelope's lyrics were further changed with ""Been you to
have any stick."" This show featured the Phish debut of Show of Life.

cleared during the encore. The opening act was Big Frog.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Paradigmatic, normal-lengthed ""YEM."" Sublimely perfect, melodious, gorgeous jam. Trey is on a mission from the start of the jam segment!   
  
[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- ""As spirited, kinetic, and vigorous as Stash gets. Incendiary peaks by Trey, anchored by booming, seismic Mike/Fish rhythms akin to those in 12.2.95 Tweezer."" Thanks @FunkyCFunkyDo!   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Intense, gripping and high energy version from a show loaded with standout performances (""YEM,"" ""SOAM,"" ""Stash,"" etc.).   
  
[Fluffhead](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/fluffhead>) \- Phish's primal, animal spirit is very present in this bad-ass version from Red Rocks. Like much of this well-regarded show, the performance is punctual, precise, and crackling with raw energy. Maybe there's a minor issue or two in The Chase, but beyond that, this one is tight. Check out Mike and Trey in Clod. Bundle of Joy is incredibly tense, and Trey and Fish's visceral screaming at the beginning of Arrival knocks this great version out of the park.   
  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- Very intense, hard rocking version with incredible tension. Released on Live Bait Vol. 6.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Frankenstein was performed for the first time since July 26, 1991 (333 shows).
Suzy subsequently included a Frankenstein tease. Fluffhead was played after a
group of fans had been requesting it since the beginning of the show.

"Phish and the ""Sleep With Me"" Podcast","If you're unfamiliar with the podcast ""Sleep with Me,"" it's a podcast designed to help those who struggle with falling and/or staying asleep get the rest they need and crave. I've listened every night for the past several months, and it's been a relaxing part of my sleep routine. 

The podcast's creator, Drew Ackerman, known as ""Dear Scooter"" on the show, tells boring, meandering stories about whatever to help encourage sleep. From time to time, he'll mention Phish or he'll use a Phish setlist to construct a story. For example, episode #743 (title: A Bunny and Owl Watch TV) uses 7/21/17 to narrate the channels the titular characters discover as they watch TV. Each station corresponds to the setlist. 

From what I remember (I am, of course, sleeping), he likes to bring up Phish from time to time but this is the most Phish-centric episode while not necessarily being about Phish. My ears always perk up when he mentions Phish. On the one hand, I'm excited. On the other hand, I'm trying to get to sleep. ",Phish Podcast
Can you hear this Sand tease?,"6-30-98 is almost a year before TAB played Sand for the first time.

Jam of the Show (JotS) - Round 2!,"**TL;DR** - Twice a week (Mon/Thurs), I‚Äôll post a show. Anyone can listen and submit their vote for the best jam. Then I‚Äôll post the results, and the next show. Rinse and repeat!

**JotS #2:**

[4-3-98](https://relisten.net/phish/1998/04/03) (Night two of Island Tour)

[Google Form](https://forms.gle/db9fGiQKpox55jLU9) for submitting your favorite Jam of the Show

**JotS #1 Result:**

**Dominant winner, with 71% of the vote: Twist!**

‚ÄúIts a twist from 98 i mean cmon‚Äù

‚ÄúWent lots of different places‚Äù

‚Äú...it spread out and then kept on spreading‚Äù

‚ÄúWOO‚Äù

**Context:**

We all know we need more structure to our Phish listening, so I‚Äôm starting a club called Jam of the Show. Really, it‚Äôs a way to compile data on the best jams of each show, and then create a forum so we can all argue about why everyone else is wrong. I‚Äôll be posting every Monday and Thursday, and you have until the next post to get your vote in. It'll be multiple choice, plus an optional open-ended box to explain yourself.

**FAQ:**

1)  This is a terrible idea and no one will participate.

Not really a question, but fair enough. If it gets no traction after a couple weeks, I‚Äôll shut it down.

2) I‚Äôm worried about admitting that Farmhouse was my favorite Jam of the Show. Is my response anonymous?

Yes, I don‚Äôt require you to submit your email, but I do require google sign-in so that people can only vote once (for Farmhouse).

3) I don‚Äôt want to be a writer with my thoughts out on the page. Do I have to answer why it‚Äôs my favorite?

Nope, that‚Äôs optional, but if there are really great comments/justifications, I‚Äôll post them.

4) Two shows a week?! Who has time for that?

I know, right? Life is crazy busy. You can participate as frequently as you want.

5) Only two shows a week?! Why can‚Äôt this be a daily thing?

I know, right? All I do is listen to Phish all day. But it does take time to create the form and post the results.

6) How are you qualified to run this?

My friend is the Mexican cousin of the ghost of David Bowie‚Äôs lawn boy‚Äôs camel walker.

7) There‚Äôs already a much better listening club. Why don‚Äôt you just join that one?

Because I didn‚Äôt know about it. How do I join?

8) I‚Äôm loving this idea! Can I pick the next show we listen to?

Thanks for your enthusiasm! Sure thing - happy to take requests and post a schedule.¬†

9) Why was the mode response for the favorite jam different from what I selected?

Because, shockingly, Phish fans love to disagree, and this is all subjective. One person‚Äôs cacophony is another‚Äôs bliss hose. Or maybe (definitely), for many of us, the cacophony is the bliss hose.

10) Woah, the show you just picked was my first show. What are the chances?

Pretty low.

11) I've already heard that show like a dozen times. Can I just vote without listening to it again?

I mean, sure, but I know you want to listen to it again now that I've reminded you about it. And you know what's better than a dozen? A baker's dozen.",Jam Show Round

[1] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[The Curtain With](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-curtain-with>) \- There are a few spots here and there in The Curtain and the beginning of With that seem a bit off. Nonetheless, Trey soloing in With seems particularly inspired, and Mike is also noticeably strong. The jam reaches a fairly intense peak, before expectedly settling to conclude.   
  
[Steep](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/steep>) \- Trey's wonderful, pretty, and soulful soloing, accompanied by Mike's on-point, cascading runs, work to create a truly notable version. Per netter @jerryguscia, Trey quickly shifts towards a bit of jamming featuring some rhythmic, low-key strumming, play which breaks to become dark and funky improvisation before dissolving into those hazy waves of sound typical for the era.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The Theme from _Rocky_ was teased before Rocky Top and Trey teased Pop Goes the
Weasel before Down With Disease. Disease was unfinished.

Encore  : [ Frankenstein ](<https://phish.net/song/frankenstein>) ^2 

[1] No whistling.  
[2] Page on keytar.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Foam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/foam>) \- Powerful Page solo with a ragtime feel. Trey brings the volume way down at first before a big peak. Sounds like '93 - '94.   
  
[Waves](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/waves>) \- This is a very well-played version with a full length ""Waves"" jam. 3 minute outro jam leads to transition to ""ASIHTOS.""   
  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Excellent full-band play featuring quiet, expansive and contemplative work from Trey, whose warm tone is complimented in great part by Page. Mike and Fish modify the beat, and the musicians dial the jam down to an all but erasure of sound. Mike and Trey team to rebuild momentum, before Trey summons a few chords and, shaping his sound, directs the band into a passage of measured and progressive space.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Reba did not have the whistling ending. Hello My Baby was played for the first
time since December 5, 1999 (140 shows). Frankenstein featured Page on keytar.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Down with Disease](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/down-with-disease>) \- A very upbeat groove develops and grows more intense as it progresses. Eventually the jam becomes more subdued before rebuilding with spacey effects and returning to ""DwD"" to conclude.   
  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- Beginning with a style and sound so typical of '00, the band then twists this jam into a bleak, nightmarish soundscape. From there, it breaks into a decent groove before finally succumbing to space.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Disease included San-Ho-Zay teases. Mike teased Dave's Energy Guide in Piper.

[1] Vocal jam.  
[2] Trey sang verses through megaphone.  
[3] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Mike's Song](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mikes-song>) \- The 1st jam segment (to 7:20) is loaded with tension and moderate dissonance. The 2nd jam begins with sounds akin to ""Simple,"" but gradually descends into a murky caldron of eerie and spacey improvisation. At 14:00, the jam begins to emerge from the underworld with low key play, a rhythmic pulse, and growing, dissonant energy, before finally returning to ""Mike's"" proper to wrap up.   
  
[Weekapaug Groove](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/weekapaug-groove>) \- Some ""CYHMK""-like jamming leads to a quieter improvisational section which pushes the bounds of ""Weekapaug"" proper. Released on Live Bait Vol. 6.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show marked the first Phish performance of A Day in the Life. YEM segued
into a HYHU vocal jam. Page teased Fanfare for the Common Man several times
before Lonesome Cowboy Bill. Trey sang the verses of Fee through a megaphone.

[1] Random Note signal.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Typically strong '94 ""Bowie"" that gets mean, nasty and thrashing as it progresses.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- A short, but magnificent version, though controversial, as some remain deaf to its majesty.   
  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- Awesome pump-it-up jam. Excellent musical variation from 3:55 - 4:30, then it's off to the ""Possum"" party.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Bowie included a Leprechaun tease by Trey. During Lizards, Trey talked about the
rocks that looked like a giant lizard and referenced the last time they played
at Red Rocks (August 20, 1993). Lizards also contained a Fanfare for the Common
Man tease from Page. Cavern included Purple Haze and Voodoo Child teases from
Trey. Tweezer contained What a Man (Linda Lydell original that was remade by
Salt-n-Pepa in 1993) quotes from Trey. Possum contained a Random Note signal.

[1] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Backwards Down the Number Line](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/backwards-down-the-number-line>) \- ""Type I"" version with great strumming by Trey and a short outro jam that > to ""Ghost.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the Phish debuts of When the Cactus is in Bloom and Alaska.
Before Dog Faced Boy, Trey explained that while living with Fish, he wrote Dog
Faced Boy, Tube and Gumbo based on entries in one of Fish's journals. During Dog
Faced Boy, Fish left his drum kit and lay down in front of the stage because he
didn't need to sing the song. Lengthwise (performed _a cappella_ ) was played
for the first time since July 28, 1998 (235 shows). Bold as Love was played for
the first time since October 6, 2000 (74 shows).

[1] Brief outro solo from Trey, which replaced the usual closing guitar lick.  
[2] First Meatstick to feature Japanese lyrics.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Funky Bitch](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/funky-bitch>) \- Atypically improvisational must-hear monster.   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Winning fans in Japan. This huge first-set-closing version raises hell and ends, but then there's a second ending that concludes cacophonously.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- Atypically slow but monstrously improvisational version that has several peaks and valleys before speeding-up and concluding in a melodic, triumphant, must-fucking-hear manner.   
  
[The Mango Song](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-mango-song>) \- Ending jam segment stretches the limits of the basic jam with some nice rhythmic variation, but still stays ""in bounds.""   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Deeeep, funky jam/groove, and the return of the B&D; segment!   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The Moma Dance included Funky Bitch teases and Tweezer included Funk #49 teases.
This was the first ever Meatstick to feature Japanese lyrics and Trey flubbed
the words while attempting to sing them. Bouncing included a brief outro solo
from Trey, which replaced the usual closing guitar lick. This show was re-
broadcast on Japanese television.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Unusual jam. Sort of off-key. Sort of evil. Dissonant and anti-melodic. No real peak; it just fades into ""Rocco.""   
  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- Improvisational playing in several sections tests the rhythmic and melodic standards for ""SOAM"" in this solid version.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Part of the soundcheck's jam consisted of 25 or 6 to 4.

Encore  : [ Highway to Hell ](<https://phish.net/song/highway-to-hell>)

[1] Trey sang verses through megaphone.  
[2] Acoustic and without microphones. Fish on Madonna washboard.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[It's Ice](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/its-ice>) \- Good rocking jam with excellent Fish and solid Trey (of course Page is great).   
  
[Mike's Song](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mikes-song>) \- The 1st jam is rocking and ass kicking, with a clever little ""Tweeprise""-like walk up. The 2nd jam is basically a non-vocal version of something very ""Simple""-like. Just listen and you'll hear it. The return to ""Mike's"" has more crazed '94 scream-infused power action.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey sang the verses of Fee through a megaphone. Ginseng Sullivan was performed
acoustic without microphones and featured Fish on Madonna washboard.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Foam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/foam>) \- -> in from ""Fee."" Groovy and excellent Page section with solid backing from Mike and Fish. It's all good from there.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Good exploratory version that gets nicely beyond the standard. Great tension, dissonance and experimental jamming.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Harpua included Funkytown teases and 'A' Train contained a Dixie tease from
Trey. The band launched into the second set-opening Whole Lotta Love Jam as the
DJ had been spinning the original Zeppelin version. The opening act was The
Aquarium Rescue Unit.

Best please to resell Modegreen 4-day pass? ,"So I‚Äôm an unfortunate turn of events - I can no longer go. I‚Äôd love to be able to sell my tickets - but I see they are still available online so I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be able to actually sell them. Definitely not trying to make a profit and would even sell at a discount (I paid 457 - but would sell them for 400 just to get some money back). 

ALSO - I have not a fully received them yet - and since the tickets are physical as opposed to digital, I imagine that selling them is an even more difficult process.

Any help appreciated! Thanks! 

Edit: best place*** to resell 

Not quite sure why I‚Äôm getting downvotes - never in my 36 years of life have I resold tickets. I imagine it‚Äôs easier when they are digital - but with the physicals I‚Äôm not sure how to go about it. I‚Äôm not scamming - nor am I trying to sell them via Reddit (although I‚Äôd consider it) - but I was just saying - they haven‚Äôt arrived in the mail yet. I bought them in January lol.

Mike bass specifics 1997-1999,"This is without a doubt my favorite Phish era and the sbds as well as auds of shows are all very, very good. 

Does anyone know what specifically Mike was using for this era defining sound?

From what I can see in pics, he had a Q5 (bolt on neck), EMG pickups, SWR amp/pre. What strings was he using? I know he‚Äôs used Slick Rounds for years, but there‚Äôs still a ‚Äúround round‚Äù tone to my ears at this point. 

Any idea what Paul was doing at the board? To my ears, this era has less actual low bass in the signal. The lowest notes are very piano-esque and defined. I‚Äôm also hearing some aggressive compression. 

How the heck does Mike play ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù at the 10th fret B string and have it sound so crisp? Zero mush. ",Mike bass specifics

If you or any of your crew are passing through Philly or Baltimore on Wednesday, I would be super grateful to catch a ride! A little about me:

* A male in his upper 20s who was recently told by a friend that he has ""respectable brains""
* Will be carrying nothing but a backpack with essentials and shenanigans (Is there a difference?) and a wizard staff in hand
* Ready to dance my ass off and have a spectabulous weekend with the Pham

In return for your kindness, I will split gas and other fees, lead some tasty vocal jams, provide good vibes, and politely listen to all of your best Phish stories! 

Shoot me a DM if you are willing to give this good-timin' hippie a ride. Thanks!",ISO Mondegreen Wednesday

Walmart Radio,I went to Walmart with my wife to pick up some medication and as we were heading to the checkout I heard Evolve start playing over their in store radio network. I hadn‚Äôt even heard Phish on the radio (I‚Äôm in Oklahoma so not totally shocking) so this is a very pleasant surprise. Has anyone else heard Evolve or anything else on the radio? Not SiriusXM,Walmart Radio

[1] Unfinished.  
[2] Keyword was ""Sour Diesel.""  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Roses Are Free](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/roses-are-free>) \- A very nice melodic jam that turns dark develops as ""Roses"" proper is winding down.   
  
[Julius](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/julius>) \- Proving again that less is more (at least for ""Julius""), Trey's nimble, amped-down playing provides interesting texture, and creates better suspension awaiting the inevitable re-build.   
  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- In a bit of a nod to the old, pre-August '93 days, the jam begins with decelerating tempo and downward sloping melodies. At 7:30, the jam shifts into the more familiar, uptempo ""modern"" ""Gin"" jam. Cool version. Check out 11/16/91 if you doubt.   
  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- Stellar 3.0 version. Trey's delicate soloing is inspired and fresh and Page fills in all the right gaps. Simply gorgeous.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Mike teased Sundown in Bathtub Gin. Down with Disease was unfinished. Makisupa's
keyword was ""Sour Diesel."" 2001 contained Sand teases from Fish and Get Up (I
Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine and Mike's Song teases from Trey.

Encore  : [ Good Times Bad Times ](<https://phish.net/song/good-times-bad-times>)


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Weekapaug Groove](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/weekapaug-groove>) \- ""Golden Age"" teases are followed by a nice funky breakdown jam with great Page and Mike. At the end, Trey sustains a note which carries into ""What's The Use.""   
  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- ""Golden Age,"" ""Happy Birthday,"" and ""WTU?"" teases worked in perfectly, along with a serious syncopated throwdown, make this one a must hear. Play this to impress others.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- A very solid jam, building from start to end, and thus in good company with 5/6/90, 11/30/95, 2/18/97, 8/8/98, and 11/27/09.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Weekapaug contained Golden Age teases. Also Sprach Zarathustra contained Golden Age, Happy Birthday and What's the Use? teases. In the soundcheck (which was played on Kevin Shapiro's From the Archives #15(b) show on 7/1/11 from [ SBIX ](<http://www.superballix.com/>) ), Funky Bitch contained alternate lyrics, Dream On contained a brief Stairway to Heaven tease and ""Old Zealand"" alternate lyrics, and The Pendulum had Two Princes quotes.

Encore  : [ Good Times Bad Times ](<https://phish.net/song/good-times-bad-times>)

[1] No whistling.  
[2] Debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Runaway Jim](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/runaway-jim>) \- After some ""Third Stone From The Sun"" (Hendrix) teases from Trey, this one gets out beyond the norm.   
  
[Prince Caspian](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/prince-caspian>) \- Debut includes a short instrumental bridge. The ending jam section and closing chords were added in 1996.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- Another wacky ""type II"" version that is worth hearing if you're an aficionado of Phish improv.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Runaway Jim contained Third Stone from the Sun teases. Reba did not have the
whistling ending. This show marked the debut of Prince Caspian. Page teased The
Sabre Dance in Tweezer. This gig was originally scheduled for the outdoor Wolf
Mountain Amphitheatre in Park City; due to a late spring snowstorm, the day
before the show took place it was moved to the indoor Delta Center.

Jam of the Show (JotS) - a new twice-weekly Phish listening club!,"**TL;DR** - Twice a week (Mon/Thurs), I‚Äôll post a show. Anyone can listen and submit their vote for the best jam. Then I‚Äôll post the results, and the next show. Rinse and repeat!

**JotS #1:** 

[4-2-98](https://relisten.net/phish/1998/04/02) (Kicking off with start of Island Tour; Debut of BoaF)

[Google Form](https://forms.gle/CXn68Hp1vhGHZMrm8) for submitting your favorite Jam of the Show

**Context:** 

We all know we need more structure to our Phish listening, so I‚Äôm starting a club called Jam of the Show. Really, it‚Äôs a way to compile data on the best jams of each show, and then create a forum so we can all argue about why everyone else is wrong. I‚Äôll be posting every Monday and Thursday, and you have until the next post to get your vote in. It'll be multiple choice, plus an optional open-ended box to explain yourself. 

**FAQ:**

*1) This is a terrible idea and no one will participate.*

Not really a question, but fair enough. If it gets no traction after a couple weeks, I‚Äôll shut it down.

*2) I‚Äôm worried about admitting that Farmhouse was my favorite Jam of the Show. Is my response anonymous?*

Yes, I don‚Äôt require you to submit your email, but I do require google sign-in so that people can only vote once (for Farmhouse).

*3) I don‚Äôt want to be a writer with my thoughts out on the page. Do I have to answer why it‚Äôs my favorite?*

Nope, that‚Äôs optional, but if there are really great comments/justifications, I‚Äôll post them.

*4) Two shows a week?! Who has time for that?*

I know, right? Life is crazy busy. You can participate as frequently as you want.

*5) Only two shows a week?! Why can‚Äôt this be a daily thing?*

I know, right? All I do is listen to Phish all day. But it does take time to create the form and post the results.

*6) How are you qualified to run this?*

My friend is the Mexican cousin of the ghost of David Bowie‚Äôs lawn boy‚Äôs camel walker.

*7) There‚Äôs already a much better listening club. Why don‚Äôt you just join that one?*

Because I didn‚Äôt know about it. How do I join?

*8) I‚Äôm loving this idea! Can I pick the next show we listen to?*

Thanks for your enthusiasm! Sure thing - happy to take requests and post a schedule.¬†

*9) Why was the mode response for the favorite jam different from what I selected?*

Because, shockingly, Phish fans love to disagree, and this is all subjective. One person‚Äôs cacophony is another‚Äôs bliss hose. Or maybe (definitely), for many of us, the cacophony is the bliss hose.

*10) Woah, the show you just picked was my first show. What are the chances?*

Pretty low.

*11) I've already heard that show like a dozen times. Can I just vote without listening to it again?*

I mean, sure, but I know you want to listen to it again now that I've reminded you about it. And you know what's better than a dozen? A baker's dozen.",Jam Show new Phish listening

Encore  : [ Loving Cup ](<https://phish.net/song/loving-cup>)


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- Unusual jam which breaks into very un-""Possum""-like sections at 6:00 and again at 7:00. Not typical at all, but very exploratory for ""Possum.""   
  
[Carini](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/carini>) \- Deploying an array of instruments and effects, including the theremin and bass effects, the band uses these tools to create a lush, densely textured and largely upbeat jam which -> to ""Taste.""   
  
[Taste](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/taste>) \- -> in from a excellent ""Carini."" Page is great in this version, which is also features Trey playing both a ""Norwegian Wood"" tease early in his solo, as well as the ""NICU"" riff signaling the concluding section. > to a strong ""Ghost.""   
  
[Boogie On Reggae Woman](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/boogie-on-reggae-woman>) \- Segues out of ""Ghost"" and includes some serious hose from Trey and reaches several satisfying peaks. Drops back into a funk groove for the last minute and the jam fades away into ""If I Could"".   
  
[If I Could](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/if-i-could>) \- > in from a powerful ""Boogie On."" Heartfelt and thoughtfully executed version adds a graceful ending to an impressive string of improvisational music.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Runaway Jim included a Buried Alive tease, Possum included a Beauty of a Broken
Heart tease and Taste included a Norwegian Wood tease (all from Trey). If I
Could was last played on November 21, 2009 (102 shows).

Encore  : [ Suzy Greenberg ](<https://phish.net/song/suzy-greenberg>)

[1] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Divided Sky](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/divided-sky>) \- Determined to make up for some serious flubs in the 5/31/11 version, Trey in this instance introduces some very cool and very different staccato playing during the jam section.   
  
[Rock and Roll](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/rock-and-roll>) \- Another excellent version with an extended jam that at various times is rhythmic, melodic, spacious, and powerful. Segue to ""Mango Song"" continues to draw praise from fans.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show marked the Phish debut of Rhymes. Antelope contained Meatstick, Bug,
and Divided Sky teases. Suzy also contained Meatstick teases. After Bug, the
crowd chanted ""Let's Go Bruins"" prompting the band to play in rhythm with the
crowd's clapping. During the ""Rye Rye Rocco"" segment of Antelope, Trey
introduced Fish as ""Ladies and Gentlemen, on cymbal, Jon Fishman!"" after he had
missed the band's unified stop in the song.

[1] Debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Fee](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/fee>) \- Like 7/5/98, a vocal flub leads to an extended outro jam that quickly moves beyond the norm. Page's ambient effects and Trey's use of the whammy pedal combine to create a jam reminiscent of the late '90's sound.   
  
[Sand](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sand>) \- One of the first great jams of 3.0. This version contains an old-school groove which goes ""type 2"" via a funk jam and an uplifting conclusion by way of a repetitive, descending riff from Trey.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- The ""Camden Tweezer."" Old school, repetitive, amazing groove. Like a '92-'94 version.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
After forgetting the lyrics to Fee, Trey remarked that ""We knew this one
backstage."" This show marked the debuts of Sugar Shack and Joy. Before the
extended encore, Trey asked, ""You guys in a rush to go anywhere?"" He then talked
about how much they had enjoyed the northeast run and that they wanted to play a
few more songs before heading south (though he was careful to note that they
love the south, too).

Encore  : [ While My Guitar Gently Weeps ](<https://phish.net/song/while-my-guitar-gently-weeps>)

[1] Debut.  
[2] Fish on trombone.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- Several sections have a bleak and desolate tone, especially from 4:30 - 5:45, but the foreboding sentiment returns later.   
  
[Taste](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/taste>) \- Debut. Jam section features the same spiraling Trey and Page musicianship, but the lyrics, vocalist, and ending would remain a work in progress for another year. ""The Fog That Surrounds"" and ""Taste That Surrounds"" are both very similar (related) songs performed in 1995 as the band tinkered with the format for ""Taste."" See the song history for ""Taste"" on this site for more information.   
  
[The Wedge](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-wedge>) \- ""The Wedge"" reemerges to close a 135 show gap. Notable principally for the now-familiar Fish-driven intro, this compact version also features cool and confident play from Trey.   
  
[Theme From the Bottom](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/theme-from-the-bottom>) \- Jam section has an unusual, repeated descending chord progression. At 8:20, it morphs into a creepy, nerve-rattling jam, returning to ""Theme"" proper at 9:55. The quality versions from 6/25/95 and 7/1/95 have a similar descending chord structure.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show marked the debuts of Taste and Acoustic Army. Trey teased Lazy in
Possum. The Wedge was played for the first time since August 20, 1993 (136
shows). Lonesome Cowboy Bill featured Fish on trombone. Suzy included an
Entrance of the Gladiators tease from Trey.

[2] Fish on trombone.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- Crazy, long early version. At one point Mike sounds like he will break into into ""Heartbreaker.""   
  
[Weekapaug Groove](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/weekapaug-groove>) \- Dissonant jam with lots of ""DEG""-like jamming.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The Chase was played for the first time since October 26, 1989 (108 shows). The
end of the first HYHU and Love You featured Fish on trombone. The opening act
was The Aquarium Rescue Unit.

---",Today Phishstory June
First time seeing Phish at Dicks.,"Hi there

I am from the UK and its my first time seeing Phish, I am flying over for the first time so making the most of it by doing all 4 nights at Dicks later this year but only have GA Stands which is fine with me as I am too old to be waiting around in the morning for a chance to be up close

Can anyone give me some helpful advice on what are the best places to be seat wise and how early I would need to arrive each day to include the lot scene etc.

Hope to meet some great people to enjoy the concert with.

Thank you

Does your local radio play Phish?,"WMVY on Martha's Vineyard plays a lot of great music including Phish. So lucky.

I remember back in the early 90's drifting on vineyard sound in the middle of the night on a  cloudless, moonless night. We were listening to WMVY laying silently in a 15' whaler. The stars were so beautiful.

WMVY put on Fast Enough For You off of Rift, I'm guessing this was right when Rift came out.

Its one of those precious memories burned into my brain because of its beauty, which made me completely present in that moment. I was young, maybe 20.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Scent of a Mule](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/scent-of-a-mule>) \- ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" tease and Trey on keys for a portion of the Duel. An odd Duel for sure with howling and strange sounds, crazy Page, and chanting by Mike. Released on Live Bait Vol. 4.   
  
[Character Zero](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/character-zero>) \- Fun debut. Notable for a strong vocals, tight play, and a decidedly different arrangement, it's clear the song is here to stay, even though ""[the band] don't know the end yet.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This unannounced show was performed under the name ""Third Ball."" BBFCFM featured
Trey using a Rolling Rock beer bottle as a slide. Scent of a Mule included a
Sunshine of Your Love tease and saw Trey on keys for portions. Waste and

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Sand](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sand>) \- Longest version to date breaks away at 7:00 and never looks back, blending multiple bliss sections with darker-tinged synth/delay play (including a ""Crosseyed"" tease from Mike at 12:00) all within the first twenty minutes. Shortly before 22:00 a tidal wave of sound starts building as the jam crests in a series of massive peaks, after which a final easy-going segment serves as an effective exhale.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The first Sand contained Crosseyed and Painless teases from Mike and an Albert
tease from Trey. Mike teased Dueling Banjos in Slave to the Traffic Light.

Super Long Post But Need Some Advice ,"I'm reaching out to the room because AXS has been completely useless.¬† I'll do my best to be concise and hope someone can offer some suggestions.¬† 

During the initial presale I was lucky enough to be able to purchase what I thought was a Glen Close Camping Package for two.¬†After reloading the page over and over, and waiting in the queue¬†for what seemed like forever, the option to purchase came up.¬† In retrospect, I should have noticed that something wasn't quite right, but I had no idea what to expect.¬† I was given the option to purchase two Glen Close Admission passes for $650.00 each and a Glen Close overnight parking pass for $50.00.¬† My total order came out to $1,350.00 plus the $20.00 payment plan fee.¬† It struck me as strange that a camping package was being sold piecemeal like that but I figured maybe that's just the way they're doing it.¬† I also noticed that the total cost was less than the advertised package fee, but at the time I was late for work and was thrilled that I had managed to get tickets at all.¬†

Over the next few days, the discrepancy in price and the way the tickets were sold began to bother me more and more.¬† I ended up going back to both the Mondegreen website and my AXS account and looking a little harder at what was going on.¬†  I realized that rather than a camping package for two, I had purchased two ""Glen Close Add-Ons"" for $650.00 each and an overnight parking pass.¬† The problem is that the ""Add-Ons"" are not supposed to be available for purchase unless you already had purchased a camping package.¬† There must have been some glitch on the website which allowed me to purchase them, despite not having purchased a camping package.¬† Of course, at the time of purchase, I had no idea of any of this, I just knew I got the ""Congratulations, You're Going To Mondegreen"" notification.¬† Immediately upon realizing what happened, I contacted AXS and tried to explain what happened.¬†

I won't go into the details of the incredibly frustrating experience I have had trying to deal with AXS customer service, but I will say that they have strung me along for the past four months, constantly telling me that someone would be in contact with me¬† ""within 24-48 hours"" and never getting a call.   At one point  a customer service representative told me that all I had purchased were parking passes and would need to buy admission tickets if I wanted to get in to the show, despite having been charged $1,370.00 over the course of the payment plan, which is now paid in full.  I finally got a representative to call me back last week, and he assured me that he would ""escalate"" the matter, and that someone would call me back within a day.¬† It's been over a week and no phone call.¬† ¬†We are about ten weeks out from the festival, and I'm still not exactly sure what I bought or if I'll be able to get into the show.¬† I know for sure that I have nowhere to stay.¬†  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

TL:DR - AXS screwed up, sold me the wrong tickets and are now ghosting me.

"If you are 1.0 fan, I strongly recommend you check out Pink Talking Fish.","The usual disclaimer applies here, I am so happy Trey is alive and sober and thriving. It's wonderful that they continue to find an audience and maybe work harder than any other 'legacy' act to keep doing new exciting things for their fans. Phish is the best.

However, (you knew it was coming), if you're a 1.0 fan like myself, the newer music doesn't move me as much as the old music. I still watch a few 'best of' clips of great jams that make the rounds but at this point in my life I don't feel a strong desire to go see Phish. I don't want a guitarist that does a mantra about being part of a bigger group before a show, I want a guitarist who will fuck my face until I split open and melt. Trey simply does not play like he used to, good or bad. That's not a subjective statement, that's an objective one. I know there are lots of people who prefer his more toned down style and that's great!

If you are like me, go check out Pink Talking Fish.  They are a Pink Floyd, Talking Heads, and Phish cover band but they are strongly rooted in Phish's musical vocabulary the way they jam in and out of songs and they way they jam in general. Their lead guitarists absolutely shreds. He fucking kills it. The drummer is beyond amazing and can hold a jam together just about as good as anyone else out there. They do organic, raw jams, meaning they will do full on improv and not know where a jam is going, not just jam on a progression like Divided Sky, for example. I can say with complete certainty that I would rather see them over Phish these days. I know I'm a minority here on this but I figured there might be a couple people out there who might enjoy this post. Go see them!

Also, I'm looking for any other recommendations of Phish cover bands that have a more 1.0 style feel and energy. Let me know!",strongly recommend check Pink Talking

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Stealing Time From the Faulty Plan](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stealing-time-from-the-faulty-plan>) \- The longest version of STFTFP up to this date stays mostly within the bounds of the song, save the ""Odd Couple"" tease. Trey's play is soaring in this very strong version of the song. > into ""Runaway Jim.""   
  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- For a song that has become, essentially, a sonic playground, what remains remarkable is that, post lyrics, what emerges is no mere template. Like so many recent iterations, full-band exploration and improvisation is unlike any previous version. More than words, this first-set closer deserves repeated listening.   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Among the slowest versions in Phish history, this version grooves along admirably but really cooks after two mins of vocal jamming, when Trey and Fish begin a second jam segment, which ""goes type II"" before seguing into ""A Wave Of Hope.""   
  
[A Wave of Hope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/a-wave-of-hope>) \- Coming on the heels of a noteworthy ""YEM"" this promising jamming debut brims with positivity as it unfurls over nigh 18 minutes and reaches a gleaming peak.   
  
[Maze](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/maze>) \- Debut of the slow arrangement (a la ""Llama""). It remains to be seen if we will be graced with another rendition or if this was a one-time entrapment.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Stealing Time From the Faulty Plan had an _Odd Couple_ theme tease from Trey.
This show included the first performance of the slow arrangement of Maze.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Back on the Train](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/back-on-the-train>) \- Page shines from start to finish.   
  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- The jam includes a number of tempo downshifts, grinding things to a near stop, including during the ending lyrics.   
  
[Steam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/steam>) \- Debut. A pleasant, relaxed Trey solo.   
  
[Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sneakin-sally-through-the-alley>) \- Following the vocal jam, the band breaks into a funky groove with a very 2011 sound to it (a bit of the staccato or ""plinko"" funk, somewhat similar to the 12/28/11 ""Cities"") that eventually gets ""Manteca""-esque before dissolving into a spacey jam. > to ""Harry Hood,"" a highly acclaimed combo among fans.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show marked the debut of Steam. Trey teased San-Ho-Zay in Kill Devil Falls.
Antelope featured a Streets of Cairo tease from Trey and saying different band
members' names (including Toph) before the ""Esquandolas"" lyric. Sally included
Manteca teases, Hood contained Have Mercy and Lizards teases, and Character Zero
contained Smoke on the Water teases.

Looking for a specific possum,"A while back, probably from like 10 years or so ago, my buddy showed me this really killer possum. They did this thing I had never heard before where they like bended the vocal parts, idk how to describe it. they would go ‚Äúpossuuuuum‚Äù and slowly bend the vocal pitches down and get lower and lower and lower, and the band would start to play dissonant notes and make it sound kinda dark and scary, then come back in really hard on key,  but then at the end they would bend the vocal notes up higher and higher. It was really spectacular.   I think this specific video was on Vimeo at the time but I can‚Äôt seem to find it there now. Does anyone have any idea what I‚Äôm talking about? Lol.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Mull](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mull>) \- A surprise is in store for those expecting the ""Mike song"" of the set to be standard fare (it was his birthday, after all). Mike and Trey are both in attack mode, which sets the stage for Mull getting its first extended treatment. If you like jams from out-of-the-box songs, this is for you.   
  
[Ruby Waves](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ruby-waves>) \- ""Ruby Waves"" asserted itself early as a Phish staple, and the song's versatility, as evinced on 12/30/19, and again, here, seemingly cements its status as part of the new Phish order. Powerhouse play, replete with ""Lizards"" licks and impassioned improvisation, creates, a la ""CDT,"" a new sort of joy, erasing anything by way of sentimentality and flips the set, which unfurls as if from an earlier era.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey teased Happy Birthday in Boogie On Reggae Woman and Contact.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Trey brings the volume way down, and then proceeds with a very gradual, ""Possum""-like build that shifts to minor key briefly before flipping back to major at the peak and finish.   
  
[Down with Disease](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/down-with-disease>) \- Inspirational, melodic and far-reaching version which includes a jam based on John Coltrane's ""A Love Supreme."" Many consider this among the very top jams of 3.0 and proof that ""DwD"" is as potent now as ever. -> ""Fluffhead.""   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Jam shifts to upbeat, major mode at 7:46 and mostly remains there for some time before shifting back at 10:40. Great one but for some excessive string bending, or perhaps flat notes by Trey.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
During NICU, Trey wished Mike a happy birthday. NICU subsequently contained a
Happy Birthday tease from Trey. Trey teased Dave's Energy Guide in Weekapaug.
Happy Birthday was teased before and during Disease. Disease also featured a jam
based on A Love Supreme and was unfinished. Also Sprach Zarathustra contained
Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine and Super Bad teases from Trey.

Desperately trying to find out what ride cymbal Fish was using in 1999! Plz help!,"Not exactly topical but I've been obsessed with fall '99 / big cypress lately ('lately'), and something that REALLY stands out is how fucking good Fishman's kit sounds in this era. I'm especially fond of the ride cymbal, which is incredibly dynamic, and all over the deep jamming at Big Cypress. I'm aware he's had 2 in the setup at various points (or always?). The one he constantly goes to for the bell is what I'm trying to track down. Exceptional cymbal. I want it. 

I was hoping to find a tour by tour gear breakdown somewhere but I'm really having trouble. I've found clues that it could be a 21"" sabian aa dry ride (which is surprising - i think I've owned one of those, nothing special), or perhaps some sort of ziljian custom dark ride.

Any leads appreciated! Even just a good image of the kit from that tour. Or a gear breakdown from any tour in that era. ETC ETC.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- Sweet Page B-3 solo at the beginning of the jam, followed by Trey.   
  
[Kill Devil Falls](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/kill-devil-falls>) \- Debut.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- After a delicate start, the jam slows even more, introducing synthesizer at 9:00 and then develops into a billowing ambient cloud before gradually shifting back to ""Hood"" at 12:15 and continues to build with some unusually tense notes from Trey. Very unique.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Stealing Time From the Faulty Plan and Kill Devil Falls both debuted at this
show, with the latter, remarkably, being played by request. This show featured
the first If I Could since June 28, 2000 (103 shows).

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Hilarious VJ!   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
It is unconfirmed whether Fire closed the first set or was even performed at
all. Trey referred to HYHU as the ""Henrietta Theme Song."" After Page played
several measures of the second HYHU in the setlist, Fish said ""There's one more
verse to this,"" and then they played the final verse of Love You. Fish also
continued to play vacuum during the third and final HYHU of the set, which also
featured Trey repeating ""Henrietta!"" over and over again, singing it along to
the music's conclusion. In response to a fan requesting more Syd Barrett after
the last HYHU, Fish spoke the first few words of Bike. Trey teased Call to the
Post before YEM (as Fish was returning to his drum kit after HYHU). Before
Contact, Fish said ""We would like to perform for you now the bass-player-is-
taking-a-leak-song."" Fish then dedicated Contact to Paul Languedoc. Also before
Contact, Page told the crowd that their bass player (whom Trey then referred to
as ""Michael Cactin"") would become 25 years old at midnight. Trey added that Mike
would now play everyone a love song.

Five Friday Fun Facts About Gumbo!,"**Gumbo Friday Fun Fact #1**:  Starting in summer 97, through the end of 03, every single version of Gumbo is on the jam charts. 23 straight Gumbos. (As seen in the accompanying images)

**Gumbo Friday Fun Fact #2**:  The word ‚ÄúManteca‚Äù appears 142 times in those 23 jam chart entries.

**Gumbo Friday Fun Fact #3**:  Tom originally named the song ‚ÄúGlumbo‚Äù, which Trey hated. Trey wanted to call in ‚ÄúGrumbo‚Äù, before they eventually settled on the name we all know and love.

**Gumbo Friday Fun Fact #4**:  Phish was going to open Oswego with Gumbo, but right before the band went on stage, a doctor from the medical tent came running over in a panic and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too hot to play Gumbo. If you play Gumbo in this heat, *thousands will die*.‚Äù  So the band opened with Tube instead, and many of us lived.

**Gumbo Friday Fun Fact #5**:  At Mondegreen, Phish is going to play a huge, 45 minute Gumbo->Jiboo. It‚Äôs going to go down as one of the all time Phish jams. And we will all call the jam ‚Äú*The Gumboo*‚Äù.


What was the best Gumbo you ever saw?

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Backwards Down the Number Line](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/backwards-down-the-number-line>) \- Great versions produce different points to view. Be it 7/8/14's summertime ""Line""d up shimmery shake; Pitt 17's huge, crazed sustain; or 10/20/21's incendiary take; this here jam features what the best ""BDNTLS"" have in common: Fire Trey. Largely straightforward guitar whose inspired improvisation, offset by impassioned Fish, is the best of its type, carrying you not so much backwards, as away.   
  
[Simple](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/simple>) \- Multi-faceted shapeshifter cruises through an array of styles ranging from heavenly bliss to industrial funk, eventually ascending to a sizable peak and then briefly returns to ""Simple"" to close.   
  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- > from ""Egg in a Hole"". A familiar propulsive jam develops, with the music initially coalescing around a repeated minor key motif from Trey. Fishman and Mike's driving rhythms provide a bedrock for Trey and Page to dole out a bevy of varying textures. The jam threatens to fall apart but comes back alive via a ""Manteca"" tease. This then morphs into a peaky, psychedelic hard rocking jam before executing a rickety > ""Prince Caspian.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Mike teased Do You Feel Like We Do before Dirt. Trey teased Prince Caspian near
the end of Egg in a Hole. Piper contained Guy Forget teases and quotes from Page
and Manteca teases from Trey. Nothing was last played on January 15, 2017 (158
shows). The Oh Kee Pa Ceremony was last played October 20, 2018 (108 shows). The
soundcheck's My Soul had Guy Forget lyrics from Fish.

[6] Fish on trombone.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Awesome version with the ""Reverend"" Jeff Mosier on banjo and Oteil Burbridge on bass. Great intro, good jam with a huge peak, and then a cool breakdown jam featuring the bass acompanied with scat singing.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
After Reba, the crowd was chanting ""cheeseburger."" Fish and Trey subsequently
went into a rap about burgers. Trey dedicated Forbin's to the Colonial (Bruce
Hampton). Forbin's was then performed with a variety of lyric substitutions of
Col. (Bruce) Hampton for Col Forbin. Rocky Top through Antelope featured the
""Reverend"" Jeff Mosier on banjo; Antelope also featured Oteil Burbridge on bass.
As Fish took the stage during HYHU, the crowd chanted for Fee. Fish sounded
perplexed and remarked that he doesn't sing Fee, but Trey and Page started the
song up anyway and left Fish on the spot. He tried his best and got through the
first verse before falling apart during the chorus. Terrapin featured Fish on
trombone. The band said ""Fee"" several times at that start of Possum, which
contained subsequent Blue Monk teases from Trey and a Rhapsody in Blue tease
from Page. BBFCFM contained an Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. The source of Set
I is phish.com.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Set Your Soul Free](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/set-your-soul-free>) \- A jam much more in line with the start of Set 2 than Set 1, boasting some warm and lovely electric piano work from Page, a really nifty minor-key exploration at Trey's urging, and a magnificent double-time finale.   
  
[Walls of the Cave](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/walls-of-the-cave>) \- A refreshing jam (and set placement) in this first version since '04 to significantly deviate from the typical format. Extra effects use loosens things up early as it dips into a short-lived, but moody darker segment, and then the jam brightens considerably at 10:00 with Trey and Page pairing up nicely for dual leads, before finally working its way back to ""WoTC"" to conclude.   
  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- Kicks off with some sprightly Trey soloing before diving into a puddle of grimy synth effects and concludes > to a strong ""Light""   
  
[Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/light>) \- > from ""2001."" The band feels connected and that connection is on display throughout this great jam. They work effortlessly as one organism as the feel and the tempo of the jam changes. > into ""Mountains in the Mist.""   
  
[46 Days](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/46-days>) \- Another deceptive offering from Spring '22 provides about four minutes of type 2 exploration in the opening slot of the encore. While not accompanied by a massive peak, fluid and enjoyable jamming from all four members will have you bopping your head with a smile on your face.   
  
[Tube](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tube>) \- A dense mind-scrambler of synths, impactful bass, and multi-toned guitar (including the ""bullfrog""), then becomes even more frazzled before the final break. The most substantial ""Tube"" jam in the encore to date, and just about as good of a jam in any encore period.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
My Friend My Friend did not contain the ""Myfe"" ending. Mike sung part of Passing
Through in Light. Golgi's lyrics were changed to ""I saw you with a barcode in
your hand."" Trey and Fish teased Mr. Completely in 46 Days.

Trey dedicated Sand to ""Max."" YEM contained a Yakety Sax (It's Ice) tease from

I think she had to view a tutorial on the drum set. But it amazing. It had LED lights that can make endless color combinations. I have a bunch more pictures cuz I was playing with it and tried to narrow it down as much as possible. We blew up a picture of the lights on the stage and put that behind it. So I can change up the lights as much as I want and even make my own colors. I also can put whatever I want on the back like a different phish lighting picture or even a picture of the crowd behind the stage. The possibilities are endless and I can honestly say, beyond a shadow of a doubt that this IS and always will be my most prized possession. Now I just need a prop place for it in my house!

No secret set at Mondegreen due to logistics?,"Unlike past festivals where almost everybody was on site, a huge number of people will be coming to Mondegreen on Phish-organized buses. This creates new logistics for the festival as they need to time all the people coming and going.  I assume this is part of the reason that they're doing a consistent 2 sets per day, only starting 1 hour earlier on Sunday.  

Given this, how are they going to do a secret set Saturday night?  They're not going to do something that excludes all the people whose buses leave 60 minutes after the end of the show, would they?  If so, what happens when all the people skip their bus to watch?  Or, is this the new Dicks of the east -- a 4 night run of 2 sets each without anything else?  ",secret set Mondegreen due

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Character Zero](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/character-zero>) \- Surprise show opener (take a look at 7/3/10 for kicks), the band shows their renewed interest in what, since 96, has primarily been a set, however rocking, holder. Fun, focused, and effects-laden, the improvisation is what we've come to expect from Phish: Effortless. Cool, introspective play seems built to spill to inform a notable ""Mike's Song.""   
  
[Mike's Song](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mikes-song>) \- > from an unexpected, massive ""Character Zero."" Fish hits the ""Beaver"" sample early and that kicks off a ""Mike's Groove"" that will last the rest of the set. The jam gets to an upbeat, feel-good bliss place before returning to what you'd expect from a Mike's jam. > to ""Bouncing Around the Room.""   
  
[Kill Devil Falls](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/kill-devil-falls>) \- Do not let the time stamp or placement fool you. Around 6:30 in, the jam shifts to light and airy interplay with major key dominance that then turns to effects-and-synth-driven goop and grime. Eventually comes back to finish and end on the ""Kill Devil Falls"" theme.   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- Jam is fairly straightforward for the first few minutes, but then there's a key modulation (type II activity afoot) and a funkaliciously melodic bridge of sorts occurs, before Page hops on the synth and Trey deploys some echoflex and then envelope filter effects. Soon melodic tension builds--slllowwwly though--courtesy of Page Mike and Trey, until there's a massive Floyd-esque echoplextastic dissonant sustained release/peak, of sorts. OF SORTS. Make no mistake: communities of ALIENS were contacted during this jam.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey teased San-Ho-Zay in Weekapaug Groove.

[1] Simpsons signal.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Great version with serious improvisation. A very exciting jam that is well orchestrated.   
  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- Classify this one in the extreme ""Anarchy"" jamming category. Jam includes Trey chanting, Fish yelling, a largely dark vibe, slow pulsing power rocking, rhythmic-driven jamming, more screaming, etc.   
  
[Esther](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/esther>) \- Terrific Page. Outstanding Trey (whose solo departs from that sound characteristically ""emotive"" to become something more ""musical""). Fish is the surpirse, here, though. Rim shots, extra floursihes and fills really work to bring this version to a fun and fiery close.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- Chaotic, frenzied, and blistering jam. Insane buildup to the peak with excellent screaming by Fish.   
  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- The ""Guitar Man Taking A Leak"" jam with Page, Fish and Mike starts the 2nd Encore, while Trey was in the bathroom.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This performance was part of the Laguna Seca Daze Festival that also included
Four Non Blondes, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, The Mother Hips and Meat
Puppets. Julius included a Buried Alive tease from Trey. Fish was introduced
during I Didn't Know as Mr. Al Unser, Jr. (who had won the Indianapolis 500
earlier in the day). Guelah contained a Simpsons signal. The jam at the start of
the second encore is often labeled as ""Trey Taking a Leak Jam"" because Trey was
in the bathroom when the band took the stage. Wilson was played by request.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Sigma Oasis](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sigma-oasis>) \- In a string of strong openers, Sigma Oasis gets the extended treatment for the second time. Soaring play from Trey kicks the jam off, which gives way to a breakdown jam. Mike is inventive and creative throughout.   
  
[Free](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/free>) \- Some dirty chord work from Trey nudges the jam out of the usual bass-guitar duel into a into a full-on barrage of synths and effects creating a killer atmospheric groove. Filthy, filthy version.   
  
[Golden Age](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/golden-age>) \- Takes a little bit of time to get going, but then resolves into a funky and bouncy jam not far away from ""YPC"", grows in power slowly and steadily, and nicely peaks before heading home. As with the 8/11/21 ""BOAF"" or 11/23/97 ""Gin"", finds its pocket and stays in it to very nice effect.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
My Mind's Got a Mind of its Own was performed for the first time since October
25, 2013 (285 shows). Page teased Frankenstein in The Final Hurrah. Fish teased
Mr. Completely in Walk Away.

[1] Unfinished.  
[2] With lyrics referencing several band members' houses (and Trey's favorite
show, House).  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Cities](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/cities>) \- Nice little extended outro with a good Trey-led peak.   
  
[Halley's Comet](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/halleys-comet>) \- Percussion driven, exploratory version that manages to cover a lot of ground in a relatively short time.   
  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- ""Gin"" -> ""Manteca"" > ""Gin."" The ""Gin"" sections, although largely straightforward, include improvisational playing by Trey. ""Manteca"" includes ""Golden Age"" jamming, with fans thus dubbing this version the ""GoldenGinTeca.""   
  
[Manteca](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/manteca>) \- -> in from ""Gin."" The jamming just before and during this ""Manteca"" includes teases of ""Golden Age,"" causing fans to dub this version the ""GoldenGinTeca."" > back to ""Gin.""   
  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- > in from ""Manteca"" to end this fine version.   
  
[Backwards Down the Number Line](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/backwards-down-the-number-line>) \- The band incorporates a lot of ""DEG"" teasing/jamming into the standard format. The mood shifts back and forth from bright to dark several times, with ""DEG""-like playing at various times throughout, before returning to ""BDTNL."" A very cool version.   
  
[Makisupa Policeman](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/makisupa-policeman>) \- An energetic, funky jam emerges at around 5:30 after some chanting on ""House."" This is a fun, well-played version.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- This ""Hood"" has a really nice jam that sounds similar to ""Faht"" at times. Returns to ""Hood"" to close.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Gin included a mash-up jam of [ Golden Age ](<http://phish.net/song/golden-age/history>) and Manteca and later closed with a Manteca quote from Trey. Disease was unfinished. BDTNL featured a DEG tease from Mike. Makisupa included lyrics referencing several band members' houses (and Trey's favorite show, [ _House_ ](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_\(TV_series\)>) ).

[1] No whistling.  
[2] Trey sang verses through megaphone.  
[3] Les Claypool on bass and Fish on vacuum; no vocal jam.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[It's Ice](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/its-ice>) \- Wild, electro-rock jam!   
  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Super version. Trey drives a great, dark, direct yet swinging groove, with Page providing really colorful fills. Mike is on-point, his play incredible, and, with Fish, inciting a sort of charge from Trey who creates an electric solo through an incredible conclusion.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This performance was part of the Laguna Seca Daze Festival that also included
Sausage, Gin Blossoms and Freddy Jones Band. Trey teased Sailor's Hornpipe in
Tweezer. Reba did not have the whistling ending. Trey sang the verses of Fee
through a megaphone. YEM featured Les Claypool playing on a second bass guitar
and Fish on vacuum, and included a band-accompanied bass duel between Mike and
Les and a Gimme Some Lovin' tease from Page, Dueling Banjos teases in the jam
segment, and a Yankee Doodle tease. YEM ended without a vocal jam. Dueling
Banjos was also teased before and during Poor Heart.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Slave to the Traffic Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/slave-to-the-traffic-light>) \- Although this version begins with spacey elements similar to 5/6/89, it also peaks in a more customary and shredding manner, reestablishing a more conventional approach to the jam.   
  
[Esther](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/esther>) \- > from ""Slave to the Traffic Light,"" this too is slow, patient, and well-played. Trey is particularly on point, deploying a series of ""jazzy"" chords before offering up a great solo.   
  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Very good early version with hilarious ""POOP"" VJ!   
  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- A somewhat dark, low-key jam opens Set III at Ian McLean's Party, builds intensity, and -> to a brief ""La Grange"" jam.   
  
[Jesus Just Left Chicago](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jesus-just-left-chicago>) \- Machine Gun Trey in combat action in the latter half of this jam.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey dedicated the Divided Sky opener to ""the spirit of the pig."" Trey briefly
teased TMWSIY before Antelope. This YEM featured the infamous ""Poop Vocal Jam,""
followed by a set-stopping keg run. Mike's Song included a tease of the HBO
theme song. Sanity was the fast version and dedicated to Eric Larson.  'A' Train
featured ""Paul,"" an unknown audience member, on saxophone and included a Dixie
tease from Trey. During Contact, Trey wished the crowd ""Merry Christmas"" several
times, quoted Blue Bayou (with slightly altered lyrics) in a falsetto voice and
teased Auld Lang Syne at the end of the song. This show featured the first known
Phish performance of Funky (Breakdown). Funky (Breakdown) and Price of Love
featured guest appearances by Ninja Mike (vocals) and Magoo (guitar). Fish
intermittently played trombone and vacuum during the latter. Melt featured a
Fish drum solo. The vocal jam at the end of Sneakin' Sally included Changes
(David Bowie) and My Sharona (The Knack) quotes. Ya Mar's lyrics included
references to wild pigs and Paul.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Soul Planet](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/soul-planet>) \- A handful of peaks scattered about a casual stroll through multiple musical ideas, both major and minor. Towards the back end, the jam becomes upbeat and bubbly and segues -> into ""Quadrophonic Toppling"".   
  
[Quadrophonic Toppling](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/quadrophonic-toppling>) \- Emerges -> out ""Soul Planet's"" jam for only its second full-throated performance alongside a bevy of Fish's samples and -> back to ""Soul Planet"".   
  
[Soul Planet](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/soul-planet>) \- -> from ""Quadrophonic Toppling"" to bookend ""Soul Planet's"" jam.   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- -> out of ""SaSS"". Goes grimy and effects-laden right out of the verses, Mike stepping to the forefront, then moves into a low-key upbeat groove. Things grow hazy and warm, almost ambient, and Fish picks up the pace to change the tenor of the jam. Page lays on the synths thick and heavy and something out of a monster movie soundtrack emerges, before Trey steers the jam back to ""CDT"" for the ending. Heavy stuff.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Llama was performed in an alternate arrangement. Quadrophonic Toppling was
performed for the first time since December 31, 1999 (606 shows). Mike teased
Dueling Banjos in Chalk Dust Torture. During the soundcheck, Mike quoted Got My
Mojo Working in the jam and Trey quoted My Shot after The Final Hurrah as well
as Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 in Gumbo.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Walk Away](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/walk-away>) \- Following a super -> from ""Wolfman's Brother"", Trey wastes no time choosing his line, and powers the band through an incredibly strong and spirited version.   
  
[Kill Devil Falls](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/kill-devil-falls>) \- A real hybrid that combines suave major mode playing with the expected minor rock.   
  
[Back on the Train](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/back-on-the-train>) \- Great version with building energy and nice back and forth between Page and Trey.   
  
[Boogie On Reggae Woman](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/boogie-on-reggae-woman>) \- Staccato jamming gives way to a ""Type II"" slowed down, effects-laden outro and > into ""Waves"".   
  
[Waves](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/waves>) \- Fantastic playing by Trey in the jam proper. Beautiful, lush and serene outro jam. In many ways the polar opposite of the haunting outro from ""IT."" Transitions to a solid ""Prince Caspian.""   
  
[Prince Caspian](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/prince-caspian>) \- > in from a great version of ""Waves."" Although shorter, this version suggests the band's willingness to take the jam segment in new and different directions, with subtle and cohesive playing. > to ""C&P.;""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Wolfman's contained a Streets of Cairo tease from Trey. Before Stash, Trey
teased The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus) by Yes.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Even though most of the jam is technically ""Type I,"" this is an intense, thriller. Don't overlook.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- Mike gets into this really great groove starting at about 8:00 that everyone else plays off. Even as Fish, Trey and Page bring the heat, Mike keeps the licks of this groove rolling. And the ending section is just smoking hot.   
  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Sweet jam featuring truly dynamic modulation and really awesome playing from Trey. The sort of version you could listen to all day. (Or at least Four times. Focusing upon each musician, independently.) Trey alights upon a great theme - accented by cool playing from Fish - before the jam swings through a build both measured and melodic to, in time, become explosive.   
  
[Simple](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/simple>) \- Crazy debut version, out of ""Mike's Song,"" naturally.   
  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- Extended hi-hat intro with the crowd shaking macaroni boxes and ""Flintstones Theme"" tease. Fish: ""Shake your macaroni!""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show marked the debut of Simple and the Phish debut of O Mio Babbino Caro.
Suzy and Possum contained _Flintstones_ theme teases. Reba did not have the
whistling ending. Nellie Kane and My Mind's Got a Mind of its Own were performed
acoustic with guest fiddler Morgan Fichter. O Mio Babbino Caro, a Puccini aria,
featured opera singer Andrea Baker singing unmiced. Before Possum, the band
handed out boxes of _Flintstones_ macaroni and cheese for the audience to shake
along with Possum and Fire.

I have gratitude for being able to explore timeless jams, read old setlists, relisten to shows, and learn about their history, which somehow always shares something new. I have gratitude that each band member is healthy enough to keep touring.

[4] Without microphones.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- Lots of screaming at various points is a good indicator that this somewhat wacky, blistering version packs some heat.   
  
[Fluffhead](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/fluffhead>) \- Although no perfect live performance may exist in this Universe, this superlative version is one of a very small handful that comes close. All the treacherous sections - The Chase, Who Do? We Do!, Bundle of Joy - these sections are nearly flawless. Like most '94 versions, this one is intense and hard rocking, yet performed with remarkable precision. Page's solo in Clod is super, while Mike's and Fish's dynamic play throughout is on full display in a high energy Arrival.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Antelope contained a Simpsons signal. Ginseng Sullivan and Dog Faced Boy were
performed acoustic and, along with Amazing Grace, without microphones. Ginseng
also featured Fish on washboard.

Encore  : [ The Practical Song ](<https://phish.net/song/the-practical-song>)

[1] Fast version.  
[2] Richard Wright on vocals.  
[3] Alternate ""Lazy Lester"" lyrics.  
[4] First known version.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- No bass & drums (""B&D;"") section. TREY IS ON FIRE!!!   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Very long intro with hilarious banter from Trey, this is the infamous LAZY LESTER BOWIE, with incredible playing by all. Hear it for yourself!   
  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- Debut. No real jam at all. Instead, the ""Bathtub Gin"" vocal refrain is extended slightly, and then the song abruptly ends.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Sanity was the fast version. Richard Wright provided guest vocals on Halley's
Comet. Sweet Georgia Brown was teased before and in the Bowie intro. Linus and
Lucy was also teased in the intro. Bowie was subsequently announced as,
dedicated to, and sung as ""Lazy Lester."" This show contained the first known
version of Bathtub Gin. Trey compared Antelope to his life-long dream of playing
hockey and dedicated the song to ""all you pro hockey players out there."" Curtis
Loew contained teases of Sailor's Hornpipe and Fishin' Hole from Trey. Possum
contained Johnny B. Goode teases.

Banter at TAB Montreal (5/19/24),"After Demons. Trey: ‚ÄúThanks for having us back, considering we‚Äôre like an hour and a half away. Thanks for inviting us. Waiting on the invitation down there in Burlington.‚Äù

Is the reason they haven‚Äôt done a Burlington show since 2011 really because they haven‚Äôt ‚Äúgotten an invitation‚Äù? Another show at the Champlain Valley Expo or Higher Ground at the Waterfront would be such a great show.

Brooklyn Plasma (Classic TAB) sounds like N4 Sphere intro music (Plasma intro),"Just noticed the way TAB played Plasma the other night in Brooklyn sounds similar to the Sphere N4 intro song that Phish lead into Plasma with. 

I really liked those intro songs at sphere. Was hoping they were a glimpse into the new album but maybe it was just side music Trey made with TAB? Was there ever any info released on those intro tracks?",Brooklyn Plasma sounds like Sphere intro music

What's going through Your Mind?,"*Discuss?..... 

-Scott Herman
What's Going Through Your Mind 

The storm had passed by quickly as the 
evening got its start 
the moon full brightly lit the skies 
clouds began to part 

SAFFY grabbed the phone & promptly notified The town

TICK emerging from below was
shocked at what he found
in one corner
JENNIFER stood firm like she'd been taught

MIKEY cried for someone to 
protect him from his thoughts
Saffy's food was thrown at Jen who 
still refused to bend

PYLON
Kept repeating that my sword's my only friend and
everyone started dancing to a song they couldn't stand
Started out slowly but as soon got out of hand

 PENNY racing down the stairs went crashing into
 KEN. 
Jennifer begged Tick to drop the needle, start again.

CHESTER wandered in dressed 
like the salamander Prince
He entertained the cat all night,
I haven't seen it since

Dregma spent the evening only staring out the door. 

Saf complained how 
tick would never notice what she wore

A howl cried out beneath the dim
No one seemed to hear. 
Finally the furniture stopped trying to interfere. 

The crowd began to dissipate but 
Tick could smell the spore
These actions like a drug would 
always bring them back for more 
more More more more

Through the years we've suffered most
From things we've never spoken
But Still I think you know 
If looks could kill 
We'd both be broken
Though After all this time it seems 
We're not each other's kind
Never think that I don't know 
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND ......
Mind mind mind mind mind mind mind 

Misty morning madness 
forms a shell around my brain
Pulls my foot inside the window 
to protect it from the rain
I'll rise again in silence 
but I hear a distant call
I turn towards the disturbance and 
find a zipper in the wall

As I slowly peel it open
 it reveals a blinding light
so I stumble through the portal 
as a force destroys the night 
adjusting to the brightness 
as the scene begins to fold

I'm surrounded by resentment 
or a mirror of my soul 
ASHAMED of My reflections
I reverse and try to flee
but the image that I run from 
Only seems to follow me 

The portal that I came through
 just ahead within the Haze 
Dissolves as I approach it 
and I only find a Maze
though My STRATEGY is WASTEFUL 
I FAIL At every turn
These corridors I wander 
are the least of my concerns

for the walls are made of MIRRORS,
So, despite what you might say, 
no matter where I turn
I know I'll never get away way way way

through the years we've suffered most
From the things we never spoken 
And still I think you know 
if looks could kill
we'd both be broken 

Though after all this time it seems 
We're not each other's kind 
Never think that I don't know 
what's going through your mind 

Perhaps a Dream could prompt you to
rewind the film that torments you &
Shows to me The one you mean 
whose tied So closely to our dreams

For You make reference many times
by saying that I'm not deprived
to this silent entity
that commandeers the dreams 
inside your mind

through the years we've suffered most
From the things we never spoken, 
And still I think you know 
if looks could kill
we'd both be broken 

Though after all this time it seems 
We're not each other's kind 
Never think that I don't know 
what's going through your mind ",going

6/20/95 - Blossom in Ohio -  I saw Trey after the show riding his mountain bike near the parking lot of this cool venue in Ohio. My pals and I had backstage passes thanks to a friend who ran their security and on our way back to the car after the after-party there came Trey wheeling down the hill!  He actually stopped and talked with us for a few mins.  Told us he was just checking out the spaceship he just played in! I told him how much I loved him and asked for a hug.  He stepped off his bike and gave me one!!

"I think the song ""Farmhouse"" is about or from the perspective of Canadian serial killer Robert Pickton, written before he was even caught.","Ok so you all know how we just had that huge Northern Light event practically all over the US. Basically everyone in the country had a chance to see them. And for some reason I started thinking about the song 'Farmhouse' by Phish because it mentions the Northern Lights and how Trey Anastasio had never seen them. I thought huh that's funny. Well if Trey Anastasio hasn't seen them than he has now. So I decided to play the song a few times for fun. Then like 3 days later I see something on the news, a Canadian man named Robert Pickton who was a serial killer had just been attacked in prison and was very close to death (this just happened like last week). Out of curiosity I read a little about it and he had been killing people at a place dubbed ""The Farm"". They would have concerts out there (even Nickelback played there early in their career). Well anyway as coincidence would have it I'm playing a song called 'Farmhouse' because ""haha Northern Lights song"" and I don't really know how it struck me but I started listening to the lyrics and I swear it seems like it could have been written about or from the perspective of the serial killer Robert Pickton. I know that sounds nuts and the song seems light hearted but if you read the lyrics and think about that situation it weirdly fits. First off the singer, Trey Anastasio has lived in the Northeast and even Canada so the idea that he's never seen the northern lights is ludicrous. So technically that would be a lie. It would also be a lie if it was said by Robert Pickton. And wouldn't you know it, the song itself mentions lying. In two places it mentions lying. The first little bit goes ""I told a lie, she got mad. She wasn't there when things got bad. I never ever saw the northern lights..."" Terrible to imagine but what if ""she wasn't there when things got bad"" meant the narrator killed the person before they did the really terrible things. And a lie like ""I've never saw the northern lights"" from someone who lived in Canada might be so dumb that it would make someone mad. 

You might be thinking to yourself well that doesn't necessarily have to do with murder. Why would you even have that on your brain? Well later on, or earlier in the song, the line ""each betrayal begins with trust, Every man returns to dust"" is said. So that at least is mentioning death. And prior to that? Each betrayal begins with trust? Is that a reference to making people trust him and then killing them? There is also reference to a woman not begging enough.  I will just show the lyrics and you can judge for yourself. Also worth noting this song came out in the year 2000 and the killer wasn't caught until 2002. Having thought to have killed near or over 40 women. 

""Welcome, this is a farmhouse  
We have cluster flies alas  
And this time of year is bad  
We are so very sorry  
There is little we can do but swat them  
She didn't beg, oh not enough  
She didn't stay when things got tough  
I told a lie and she got mad  
She wasn't there when things got bad  
I never ever saw the Northern lights  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
In the farmhouse, things will be alright  
I never ever saw the Northern lights  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
In the farmhouse, things will be alright  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright  
Woke this morning to the stinging lash  
Every man rise from the ash  
Each betrayal begins with trust  
Every man returns to dust  
I never ever saw the Northern lights  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
In the farmhouse, things will be alright  
I never ever saw the Northern lights  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
In the farmhouse, things will be alright  
I never ever saw the Northern lights  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
In the farmhouse, things will be alright  
I never ever saw the Northern lights  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
I never ever saw the stars so bright

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright  
Welcome, this is a farmhouse  
Welcome, this is a farmhouse  
I never ever saw the Northern lights  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
In the farmhouse, things will be alright""

Also, ""every man returns to dust"" could be a reference to the fact that the killer was feeding dead people to his pigs. Believe or not believe. Apparently a bunch of people think that while one guy took the wrap for all those killings that a bunch of people knew about it and/or took part.",think song perspective Canadian serial killer Robert written even

A definitive Jam of 3.0- 8/12/2015 Twist ,"I went out of my way to not use ‚Äúthe best‚Äù or any other hot take verbiage that I usually see in a post like this, but this jam is everything Phish and I hope to highlight the things I love about it. I don‚Äôt know why, other than I‚Äôm up in the middle of the night and I can‚Äôt sleep so I Reddit. 

The song starts in normal 3.0 twist style with a syrupy slow and deliberate pace. Once you get through the wooing (love it or hate it- I‚Äôm a love it guy) it immediately goes dark. Out of the shadows page and Trey stab out shots of light and fire while Mike lays down a murky beautiful line. 

They go into this call and answer between all three of them that is just beautiful. Often jams are trey jamming and the rest of the band filling texture and definition, but the first part of this jam feels very much like I‚Äôm watching a conversation unfold musically between four amazing musicians. 

It continues this way, crawling out of the darkness like a giant spider with too many shadows legs that seem to phase in and out of existence. About 7 minutes in Trey and page start adding massive texture and Mike responds with these elongated high bass notes. Trey finds a line to added some optimistically lonely notes on top of the murk and grime. Mike drops the bass. 8 minutes in Trey pulls out some whale calls and if you‚Äôre not crying at this point you‚Äôre not listening loud enough. This is just a gorgeous peak and everything that phish is capable of. 

It‚Äôs not a bliss jam. It feels lost and lonely and hopeless, but also confident and meaningful and optimistic. Just awesome.

Then trey pulls back, and it seems like he‚Äôs trying to end the jam here, which would be fine. But, Mike. He refuses to conform. He might have said no verbally before, but he says it musically here. The rest of the band responds, and they look mutually for direction. Trey keeps trying, Mike keeps saying no. Page joins Mike. Finally, Trey joins the journey and at 12 minutes hits some feedback while give Mike space to shine. 

We‚Äôre off again. Mike goes way up on the bass and sets an almost Arabic tone as a base to move forward. Fish joins in. We go to an almost reggae but not quite sound which contrasts the front half of the song, and is surprisingly blissful and gives a lightness to the jam that hasn‚Äôt been present until now. 

16 minutes in, and fish sets the tempo. Rising from the smoldering ashes and shadows of the jam fish and Mike get in the drivers seat and and slam on the gas. From the hopeless void of the first half of this jam, a thundering vehicle bursts forward. Trey sets a line as the tempo increases. From what felt murky and dark bursts a jam that is full of light, shadows are burnt away and banished back to where the came from.

The tempo increases and trey goes full bliss god. The band as a unit drives the jam higher and higher, bringing a euphoric close that in any other jam would make it worth a listen, but in the context of the dark first half of this jam creates such a beautiful journey that I so rarely see from phish at any era. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a rocking major key bliss jam this isn‚Äôt for you. If you enjoy a musical conversation between 4 musical geniuses, this is a definitive jam of 3.0 and an absolute example of the very best that phish is capable of. 

This has been my Ted talk. ",definitive Jam Twist

"6/15/2000 YEM - Big Cat, Japan","I mean my god it‚Äôs filthy. The PJJ version of this jam isolates the bass & guitar so well. It makes me tingle in my bathing suit area.

Question for my players out there: what is the effect Trey is layering here? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the reverse delay, sounds more like some digi crap. I think he does it again on the Fiddler‚Äôs Green Piper later that Fall. 

It really helps build the tension in this exceptional YEM jam. As if he wants the notes to express but lets the effect reduce the full resolve and expression as a way of building some tension.

TAB N2...again it's the new stuff that stands out,"Best songs of the night were Mists of the Past and Whats Going Through Your Mind. Snowflakes on the Sand isn't new but its new-ish to the setlist. 

Trey continues on his run of truly epic songwriting. 

Mists of the Past had a kind of perky retro 70s ish progression with a little walkdown turnaround. Felt a bit like an Elton John song without piano. 

What's Going Through Your Mind was lot of fun rhymes with a bouncy, rhythmic almost They Might Be Giants-esque vibe. And it broke into an EXCELLENT set ending jam. 

Oblivion has been played a few times in the last couple of years, but it's so Nile Rodgers inspired with the bassline and the Wong-esque funk strumming. That was my first time hearing it. I hope that song gets to the Phish setlist. 

Snowflakes on the Sand (it's like snow on the beach, weird but fucking beautiful?) kinda breaks in to this Scotch Irish Appalachian folk song type vibe. There's little bluegrassy fills and the song lilts the same way. Think Billy Joel's ""The Entertainer.""

I think one of the reasons I really love Trey's songwriting right now is that it's SO diverse. It's like...all the styles, all the grooves. It's a masterclass in deep appreciation of classic forms. 

The artist I have seen live most in my life is probably Billy Joel. I am right next to MSG I am there a lot. And he does a similar thing with musical styles. There's a zydeco jam and a sea shanty and an Irish drinking song and a Spanish 3/2 clave beat and a French Chanson, and some disco and some jazz and some lounge music. There's just a little bit of every form and I just love to see a songwriter with so many influences. 

But the other standouts were a pretty heavy Carini closer and a big Ocelot jam. Also I fucking love Life Saving Gun. 

I shall miss N3 since I am going to see Mick and Keef and the Stones tonight. I do need to sit at the feet of all the masters. But someone keep us apprised of the new stuff. ",TAB new stuff stands

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[The Curtain With](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-curtain-with>) \- A well-executed Curtain - not spotless, but few, if any, are. This With jam is evocative and captures a sense of weigtlessness, soaring above the musical clouds. Many of these early With jams move beyond this uplifting section, exploring more dissonant, rocking terrain. Not so here, as the band seems content to let this one gracefully recede, following a soaring peak.   
  
[Jesus Just Left Chicago](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jesus-just-left-chicago>) \- Preceding the famed Slip Stitch and Pass version by 9 years, and longer by more than 2 minutes, this jammed out version includes Page rocking first the piano, then the B-3, and a great Trey solo leading to an extended band-wide blues rocker. Part of a 3 song set! (""JJLC"", ""Fluffhead"" > ""Whipping Post"").   
  
[Whipping Post](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/whipping-post>) \- The straightforward first jam section is very extended, to 17:00, and includes great modulation of intensity and lots of Trey shredding. The second jam features Page on the B-3, followed by solid, rocking, but much more in-the-box jamming than some of these versions.   
  
[Ya Mar](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ya-mar>) \- Awesome version which transitions to a reggae party with Jah Roy.   
  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- With Jah Roy n vocals. An excellent reggae medley is led by Jah.   
  
[Run Like an Antelope](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/run-like-an-antelope>) \- The first truly ""Type II"" version (beginning about 10:00) has a settled section with some ""DEG""-like jamming. This version also has sections of intense, chaotic dissonance and great Machine Gun Trey action.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Ya Mar and the ensuing jam featured vocals from Jah Roy; the jam contained One
Love quotes from Jah Roy and Trey. Halley's Comet featured vocals from Richard
Wright. I Didn't Know featured Wright on drums and Fish on trombone. BBFCFM
contained _Flintstones_ theme teases from Trey. The master recordings confirm
this listing as the correct performance order. Many recordings of this show
circulate with an incorrect song order, an incorrect date (May 25, 1988) and an
incorrect venue (Ian's Farm, Hebron, NY).

Show Notes: This show was part of [DelFest][3]. Before I'm Blue, I'm Lonesome, Trey related
a story about his travels in the early 90s with Col. Bruce Hampton & ARU, about
how the ARU mandolin player, Matt Mundy, had turned Phish on to [_Blue Side of
Town_][4] by Del McCoury, and how that then became a staple of road music in
Phish's van. Trey then noted Del's appearance at Phish's 1999 [Oswego
festival][5], and how excited he was to now be playing at Del's festival. I'm
Blue, I'm Lonesome and Beauty of My Dreams featured guests Del McCoury, Ronnie
McCoury, Jason Carter, and Rob McCoury. Heavy Things and Black Dog featured
Ronnie McCoury, Jason Carter, and Rob McCoury.

extended jam at Treya‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s on-stage request.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Ya Mar](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ya-mar>) \- An excellent rhythmic, snappy jam emerges with a lot of ""DEG"" and ""Digital Delay Jam""-like sounds from Page and Trey at first (from about 8:30 - 11:00). Trey started the song in the wrong key (G) but asked Page to modulate to the key of A (the proper key) before his organ solo.   
  
[Taste](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/taste>) \- A different version with a relaxed, toned-down feel throughout, but it is also deftly played with near precision.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show was taped for VH-1's _Hard Rock Live_ and was first broadcast on July
1, 2000. The show was announced only a week before the gig took place. Non-
transferable wristbands for entry were sold at the venue box office the morning
before the show, with a limit of one per person. Ya Mar began in the key of G
before switching to its normal key of A for an extended jam at Trey's on-stage
request. During the soundcheck of this show, Driver and Ginseng were played
multiple times, and there was a jam on Led Zeppelin's Dancing Days before Long
Cool Woman.

"Trey's solo acoustic version of ""Time Turns Elastic"" from The Barn is fantastic","Somehow I'd never seen this until today. When I saw the thumbnail I thought to myself there was no way Trey had actually gone through and meticulously arranged this tune for fingerpicking. I was so pleasantly surprised to find that he had, and he plays/sings all 13+ minutes pretty cleanly. If you're like me and didn't realize this existed, check it out!

Best jams for endurance ,I recall reading that an ultramarathoner listens almost exclusively to Phish and Dead because his runs are so long and he likes getting lost in the jam particularly when doing such intensely long and somewhat monotonous workouts.

Super sweet in the pocket Floydian jam, I was a HUGE fan. My best show friend and I...we ended up getting the Saturday and Sunday of the Gilmour run at MSG. That Monsters jam got me all riled up for it. 

Honestly all the new stuff is incredible this dude is doing the best songwriting of his life right now. The Kid in the Sky (the leaves are falling down) was wonderful. Then Monsters the Floyd style jam, Evolve and The Well back to back was killer. Evolve is just great songwriting start to finish. The Well had some dirty bluesy Zeppelin vibes...which got reprise for the Ghost closer. (I don't know if there are any other dirty bluesy Blackface tone Ghosts...but I definitely like it better than funky Ghost.)

They fuse all of the music I ever loved growing up and so thank god no one introduced them to me at 16 or else I would have run away with the circus forever. I‚Äôve seen 3 shows so far and each was an intense experience. 

What im realizing most now is how much I lean on the music in hard times. 2020 obviously was what it was. At the moment im battling a tough year with a recent layoff, career change, young kids to raise, and some marriage problems. I never really believed in the ‚Äúmusic as a source of healing‚Äù type of thing until I found Phish. 

I guess the point of this post is to vent these feelings a little. Anyone else feel this?",Phish helps hard times

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[The Mango Song](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-mango-song>) \- Essentially straightforward, but the band nicely extends the ending jam segment by a few minutes.   
  
[Ghost](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ghost>) \- Mesmerizing conglomeration of tesselation and coruscation. [Mellow groove with some spacey effects rolls along until 13:55, when the jam gets more rocking, then breaks into a fantastic and serene groove that swells and dissipates.]   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
David Bowie contained Bouncing Around the Room and San-Ho-Zay teases.

**Show Notes:**  
  
This show included the first known Phish performance of St. Thomas. Sneakin'
Sally contained DEG teases. Prior to Letter to Jimmy Page, Trey announced that
per ""Del's"" request, they were going to play Letter to Jimmy Page as a band, and
then Fish would play it by himself (telling the crowd that Fish didn't know it).
YEM was dedicated to Del and La Grange was dedicated to Mike. Bike featured a
Fish trombone solo. The date for this show may be incorrect; note that Trey
referred to Tela as a debut at this show, though it actually debuted on 3/12/88.

off to college. Trey dedicated Water in the Sky to a fan who had caused a minor
disruption as a bargain so that she would return to her seat. Brian and Robert

‚ÄúPhish is breaking up‚Äù 2004 flashback,"So, it‚Äôs a long story but I was looking for something long lost and stumbled upon this post I made on an Old School skateboard collectors forum. At the time I was really not listening to a lot of Phish, or anything Jam related, but [hearing the news provoked me to make a post.](https://www.skullandbonesskateboards.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=22738&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=Caspean&start=0)

Looking back at my hubris of trying to argue the merits of Phish to a bunch of old skate punks is pretty funny, especially since at the time I was pretty much only listening to punk and metal and the occasional Latin jazz ensemble.

I especially liked my reply about why the boys aren‚Äôt just 60‚Äôs SF copycats

‚ÄúThe late 60's era music, primarily the 'psychedelic' genre known to have come from San Francisco, was grounbreaking and pretty much brought about a whole new conciousness regarding music, community and love. This is a similar concept embraced by those who have been atracted to the music of Phish. I must denote however that it is not merely the community or the philosophy that brings this group together, but primarily and wholeheartedly the music. The expresiveness that is brought about by improvisational music is felt and experienced not only by the band, but the audience as well. It is a connection. One that cannot be explained, only experienced.

Jaded and less-insightful individuals can minimalize this to mere drug-induced whimsy, but the experienced knows that, this is not chemical. This is not fantasy. This is deep and real, and is beyond anything that words can describe.

If you don't know, you never will.‚Äù

After Velvet Sea, Page talked about how he had often visited Radio City as a
kid. Trey then noted that he and Page had seen Stevie Wonder at this venue, and
he discussed about how much the band appreciates the support of fans.

Trey quoted Tin Man in Dinner and A Movie. The Bowie intro contained a Sample
tease. Trey teased Smoke on the Water in the Big Ball Jam. Before Harry Hood,
Fish and Trey acknowledged the crowd's varied requests but noted that they
couldn't understand what songs people were yelling for. Fish responded by
screaming incoherently, mimicking what the crowd noise sounded like to him on
stage. Trey noted that the band had been playing all night and wanted to give
the audience a chance to perform. He counted off to the crowd, who responded
with assorted clapping and cheering. Fish jokingly remarked ""you guys haven't
played that in so long."" Hood contained Across the River (Peter Gabriel) and
_Odd Couple_ theme teases.

Thoughts On The New Phish Album,"As I expected, it's a bunch of tracks that we've already heard before, many of which have already been released on previous studio albums by Trey.

I'm honestly not sure what the point of releasing an album like this is at this point in their career.  It obviously won't make a difference in terms of their draw as a live act and I can't imagine they will make much money from it in streams....

My hope is that we get one more studio album with more epic compositions like Fluffhead, David Bowie, YEM, Guyute, etc... to cement their legacy as the greatest band ever.

I realize the chances of this are low, but as a life long Phish fan, this is my fantasy.

Anyway, not to diss the band, I love them and a few of the tunes are pretty cool, like Oblivion I really like, but I don't know, seems like they could do more in the studio....  Just my two cents.",Thoughts New Phish Album

- saw D&C in 200 and 300 level outer edges (Mike/Otiel side)

- Phish mix was way _clearer_ - I could easily hear and pick out each instrument (and vocal) from the mix. It shocked me how clear it was. (This point is entirely separate from the balance of the mix which took some time to get fixed). 

- D&C mix was consistently muddier, but still what I would call significantly better than your average arena sound. Sounded like it contained more ‚Äúnatural arena reverb‚Äù than the Phish sound, and definitely did not strike me with the same shock and awe. 

Did anyone else here go to both and take note of their impression of the sound at each? I‚Äôm struggling with the fact that I now am mistrustful of my impression of Phish! 

Was the sound, in fact, different and better at Phish, or did I just finally get to experience natural variation of sound at the venue? Did the bands sound engineering staff make that much of a difference between the bands and their shows? I know Phish practiced for this at Lititz and put in a lot of work in ahead of time - don‚Äôt know what D&C did along those lines, or what notes they may have cribbed from Phish, if any. 

I only saw one night of Phish, but because both nights of D&C left me with similar impressions, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a band and sound crew difference I heard. 

Seeking informed thoughts and opinions, thanks for making it this far. 

EDIT: SOLVED - Phish‚Äôs collective attention to detail for the Sphere shows was a straight up act of love that you could see, feel, and especially hear. Rest easy fellow Phish nerds - our boys did it up right like no one else!",Sphere sound retrospective analysis

I went to the Classic TAB show in Cleveland last week and had a great time, it was actually the first Phish-related show I've ever attended.

And the crowd was great.  Everybody got into a deep heavy groove.  I had a revelation (among many) that I maybe read too much reddit.  The folks that were there weren‚Äôt tarping and there was no divisiveness that I could see. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a thing but it was not prevalent last night.

Trey Lookalike,"At the TAB show in Lafayette yesterday, I was looking around, taking it all in, when I noticed a man walking through the crowd who looked like Trey!

It was one of those moments when I questioned whether I was tripping. He got closer to me, and I realized he had a ponytail but looked like our guy from the front. 

Does anyone here know him or have had a similar experience before? It definitely scared me at first.

Mondegreen pass transfers,"Any advice/experience with purchasing mondegreen passes from someone else? If there is no transfer through AXS and the seller is asking for money now, how can you protect yourself if the seller doesn't ship the passes when they receive them?

AXS said account holder can change the shipping address, but the account holder can change it as much as they want up to JUNE 28TH. So potentially they could change the shipping address to your address, screenshot to appease you, then change it back to their address and not send passes when they receive them.

This would not be considered online purchase so to my interpretation of Paypay G&S, they would not cover this transaction.

What‚Äôs going through your mind lyrics,"Debuted on May 9, 2024

The storm had passed by quickly as the evening got it‚Äôs start

The moon full, brightly lit the sky as clouds began to part

Safy grabbed the phone and promptly notified the town

Dick emerging from below was shocked at what he found

In one corner Jennifer stood firm like she‚Äôd been taught

Mikey crying for someone to protect him from his thoughts

Safy‚Äôs food was thrown at Jen who still refused to bend

Pilon kept repeating that my swords my only friend

And everyone started dancing to a song they couldn‚Äôt stand

It started out slowly but it soon got out of hand

Penny racing down the stairs went crashing into Ken

Jennifer begged Dick to drop the needle start again

And Chester wandered in dressed like the salamander prince

He entertained the cat all night I haven‚Äôt seen it since

Drake was spending evening only staring out the door

Saf complained how dick would never notice what she wore

Khor cried out beneath beneath the den but no one seemed to hear

Finally the furniture stopped trying to interfere

The crowd began to dissipate but Tim could smell the spore 

These actions like a drug would always bring them back for more more more 


Through the years we‚Äôve suffered most

The things we‚Äôve never spoken

And still I think you know

If looks could kill wed both be broken

Though after all this time it seems

Not eachother‚Äôs kind

Never think that I don‚Äôt know

What‚Äôs going through your mind


Misty wanted madness, formed a shell around my brain

Pulls my foot inside the window to protect it from the rain

I rise again in silence but I hear a distant call

I turn towards the disturbance and find a zipper in the wall

I slowly peel it open, it reveals a blinding light

So I stumble through the portal as a force destroys the night

Adjusting to the brightness as this evenings gets to fold

Im surrounded by resentment or a mirror of my soul

Ashamed of my reflection, I reverse and try to flee

But the image that I run from only seems to follow me

The port hole that I came through just ahead within the haze

Dissolves as I approach it and I only find a maze

Though my strategy is wasteful and I fail at every turn 

These corridors that I wander are the least of my concerns 

But the walls are made of mirrors despite what you might say

No matter where I turn I may never get away way way 


Through the years we‚Äôve suffered most

The things we‚Äôve never spoken

And still I think you know

If looks could kill we‚Äôd both be broken

Though after all this time it seems

We‚Äôre not eachothers kind

Never think that I dont know

What‚Äôs going through your mind

Anyone else experience this?,"You know how with other music especially pop music lyrics will get in ur head and you can‚Äôt get them out no matter how hard you try even if you don‚Äôt like the song? For example, the day of the eclipse my bosses daughter kept singing ‚Äúblinded by the light‚Äù, not sure if that‚Äôs the name of the song but we all know it. We didn‚Äôt know the exact lyrics so I felt compelled to look them up and couldn‚Äôt get that damn song out of my head for hours. Well when it comes to phish this happens to me more with jams than lyrics. I‚Äôll lay down to go to bed and my favorite jam from a particular song will make its way into my brain and I can‚Äôt go to sleep til I‚Äôve played the jam in full in my head. And we all know when it comes to phish that can take a long time sometimes! And sometimes I can‚Äôt place what song it is from and it drives me bonkers until I do.
